 Τι νέοι, τι νέοι, τι νέοι, τι νέοι, τι νέοι...lighting Ότι θέλεις για σ' ενα θα κάνω Ενα οχεία μου πίσω πεθάνω Ότι θέλεις μορό μου, πες μου τι, τι, τι, τι, τι. I see you and I die, I don't have any more You send me, you have hidden me in a light What do you want me to do to you, come on, what? You send me, you have hidden me in a light You send me, you have hidden me in a light You send me, you have hidden me in a light I stop my heart now in my mind, I will give you a light if it happens Tell me what will happen, come on, what? You send me, you have hidden me in a light You send me, you have hidden me in a light I stop my heart now in my mind, I will give you a light I stop my heart now in my mind, I want to lose it What do you want me to feel, come on, what? You send me, you have hidden me in a light You send me, you have hidden me in a light You send me, you have hidden me in a light Φτάνω από το σύνομο κομμάτι.
