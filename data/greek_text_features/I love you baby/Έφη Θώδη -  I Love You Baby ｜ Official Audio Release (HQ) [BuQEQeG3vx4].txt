 You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You feel I have end to touch I wanna hold you so much At long last life I survive And I think I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you Part on the way that I step There's nothing else to cover This soft of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak Showing you feel like I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you I love you baby I love you baby You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You feel I have end to touch I wanna hold you so much At long last life I survive And I think I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you I love you baby I love you baby I love you baby Ευχαριστώ για την εξογραφή που έγινε.
