 Drink up baby, stay up all night With the things you could do, you won't But you might The potential you'll be, that you'll never see The promises you'll only make Drink up with me now, and forget all about The pressure it takes Do what I say and I'll make you okay You drive them away, the image is stuck in your head People you've been before that you don't want around anymore They push and shove and won't bend to your will I'll keep them still Drink up baby, forget the stars The kiss you can't be told anymore It's worth seeing you there With your hands in the air Waiting to finally be caught Drink it one more time and I'll make you mine I'll keep you in my heart and take all my heart Separate from the rest, while I like you the best We'll keep the things you forgot People you've been before that you don't want around anymore They push and shove and won't bend to your will I'll keep them still you
