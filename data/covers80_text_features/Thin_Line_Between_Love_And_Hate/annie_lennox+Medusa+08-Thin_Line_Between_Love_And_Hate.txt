 It's a thin line between love and hate It's a thin line between love and hate It's five o'clock in the morning and you're just getting in I knock upon the door, a voice sweet and low says She opens up the door and she lets you in And never once does she say, where have you been? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh She says, hold it, are you hungry? Did you eat yet? Let me hang up your coat now And all the time she's smiling, never raises her voice It's five o'clock in the morning and you don't give it a second thought It's a thin line between love and hate It's a thin line between love and hate The sweetest woman in the world, maybe the meanest woman in the world Maybe make her be that way She might be holding something in It's really gonna hurt you, one of these fine days Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh There you are in the hospital, bandaged from foot to hand In a state of shock, that much from being dead You didn't think your woman could do something like that to you You didn't think she'd got the nerve Accidents speak louder than words, louder than words, louder than words, louder than words Come on baby, baby, you don't give a damn about me Come on baby, baby, you don't really care about me Come on baby, baby, you don't give a damn about me Come on baby, baby, you don't really care about me Come on baby, baby, you don't give a damn about me Come on baby, baby, you don't really care about me You know what I say, you know what I say You know what I say, you know what I say You know what I say, you know what I say You know what I say, you know what I say You know what I say, you know what I say you
