 It's a thin line between love and hate It's a thin line between love and hate It's five o'clock in the morning I'm just getting in I knock on the door A voice, sweet and low, says Who is it? She opens up the door and let me in Never once do she say, where have you been? She says, are you hungry? Are you hungry, honey? Did you eat yet? Let me hang up your coat The woman tells me, pass me your hat All the time she's lying Never raises her voice It's five o'clock in the morning I don't give it a second thought It's a thin line between love and hate Don't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart It's a thin line between love and hate And she'll sit back and enjoy it It's a thin line Yes it is, yes it is Between love and hate She's gonna rule you one day The sweetest woman in the world Could be the meanest woman in the world If you make her that way You keep her, she keep being quiet She might be holding something inside That'll really, really hurt you one day Here I am laying in the hospital Bandaged from feet to head In a state of shock Not just that much from being dead I didn't think my woman would do something like this to me I didn't think my girl had the nerve Here I am I guess action speaks louder than words It's a thin line between love and hate Don't think you can keep treating your woman bad It's a thin line between love and hate And she won't ever get mad It's a thin line Yes it is Between love and hate She's gonna rule you one day
