Are every smile desire? If I lost you, would I cry? Do I love you, baby? Yeah, baby, baby Now when you were a young boy, did you have a puppy? Who always followed you? Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as a puppy You know I'll never let you down It goes on and on like a river flows And it gets sweeter, babe, than heaven knows Sweeter, babe, than it grows Do I love you my old man? Are every smile desire? If I lost you, would I cry? Do I love you, baby? Yeah, baby, baby Do I love you, baby? Do I love you, baby, like a flower loves the spring? Gotta love you, honey, like a robin loves the swing Gotta love you, baby, like a schoolboy loves his man Gotta love you, honey, like a river steeps mountains high Baby, baby Do I love you my old man? Like a river steeps mountains high If I lost you, would I cry? Do I love you, baby? Yeah, baby, baby Do I love you, baby? Oh! Aha! Thank you for watching!
