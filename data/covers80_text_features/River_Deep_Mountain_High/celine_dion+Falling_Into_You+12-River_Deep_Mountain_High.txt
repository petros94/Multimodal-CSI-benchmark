 When I was a little girl I had a rock dog Only dog I've ever owned Now I love you just the way I love that rock dog But only now my love has grown And it gets stronger in every way And it gets deeper, let me say And it gets higher day by day And do I love you my oh my? Can a river keep a mountain high? If I lost you would I cry? Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby When you were young but did you ever thought that That a waste followed you around? Well I'm gonna be as free fall as the bucket No I'll never let you down And it gets stronger like a river flows And it gets deeper baby than heaven knows And it gets sweeter baby as it grows And do I love you my oh my? Can a river keep a mountain high? If I lost you would I cry? Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby I love you baby like a flower loves the spring And I love you baby just like a gene on love's the same And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his fame And I love you baby river deep mountain high Oh yeah, you gotta believe baby Like a gene girl, in love and time and in heaven Oh yeah, do I love you my oh my? Can a river keep a mountain high? If I lost you would I cry? Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby Do I love you my oh my? Can a river keep a mountain high? If I lost you would I cry? Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby If I lost you would I cry? you
