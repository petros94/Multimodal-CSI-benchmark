 You all sing along. Left a good job in the city, working for me every night and day. Bet I never lost one minute of sleepin', and by the way things might have been. I think we'll keep on toying, and I'm in it to keep on boiling. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Made a lot of waves in Memphis, I said Memphis. Poured a lot of pain down New Orleans. Bet I never saw a good side of the city, till I hit the ride on Riverboat Queen. Think we'll keep on toying, and I'm in it to keep on boiling. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. New York. . Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. . If you come down to the river, bet you're gonna find the people who live. You don't have to worry, though you have no money. People on the river, happy to give. Big wheeler, keep on toying and toying. I'm married to a corn boy. Roller, roller. Oh, Lord. Rolling on the river. Roller, roller. Yeah. Rolling on the river. Roller, roller. Yeah. Rolling on the river. Roller, roller. Yeah. Rolling on the river. Roller, roller. Yeah. Rolling on the river. Roller, roller.
