I walk for miles along the highway, well that's just my way of saying I love you. I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you. I stop to see a weeping willow, crying on his pillow, maybe he's crying for me. And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be. I go out walking after midnight, out in the moonlight, just hoping you may be somewhere walking after midnight, searching for me. I stop to see a weeping willow, crying on his pillow, maybe he's crying for me. And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be. I go out walking after midnight, out in the moonlight, just hoping you may be somewhere walking after midnight, searching for me. I go out walking after midnight, searching for you. I'm always walking after midnight, out in the moonlight, just hoping you may be somewhere
