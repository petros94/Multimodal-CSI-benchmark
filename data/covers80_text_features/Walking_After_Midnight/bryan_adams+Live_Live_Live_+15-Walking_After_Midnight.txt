 I go out walking, after midnight, out on the moonlight, just like we used to do. I'm always walking, after midnight, searching for you. I walk for miles, along the highway, but that's just my way of staying out of view. I'm always walking, after midnight, searching for you. I start to see a wimpy widow, she's crying on a pillow, maybe she's crying for me. And in the skies that blue me, never look but to me, I'm run through as I can be. I go out walking, after midnight, out on the moonlight, just to open you, maybe you're out there. Walking, after midnight, searching for me. Yeah. I start to see a wimpy widow, she's crying on a pillow, maybe she's crying for me. And in the skies that blue me, never look but to me, I'm run through as I can be. I go out walking, after midnight, out on the moonlight, just like we used to do. I go out walking, after midnight, searching for you. I go out walking, after midnight, out on the moonlight, just to open you, maybe somewhere. Walking, after midnight, searching for me. Yeah. I'm a... King!
