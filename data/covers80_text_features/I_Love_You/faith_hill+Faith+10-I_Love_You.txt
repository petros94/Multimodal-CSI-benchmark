 I must be crazy now, maybe I dream too much But when I think of you, I long to feel your touch To whisper in your ear, words that are old as time Words only you would hear, if only you were mine I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you Should I have made my move when you looked in my eyes Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do And you'd whisper these words as you lied here by my side I love you, please say you love me too These three words, they could change our lives forever And I promise you that we will always be together Till the end of time So today I finally find the courage deep inside Just to walk right up to your door But my body can't move when I finally get to it Like a thousand times before And without a word you handed me this letter Well I hope this finds the way into your heart I love you, please say you love me too Till the end of time Maybe I, I need a little loving Maybe I, I need a little care Maybe you, maybe you need somebody just to hold you If you do, just reach out, I'll be there I love you, please say you love me too These three words, they could change our lives forever And I promise you that we will always be together Oh, I love you Please say you love me, please say you love me too Till the end of time Oh baby, my baby Oh, together forever Oh, I love you Yeah, yeah Oh, I will be on my side Oh, I, oh I love you Thanks for watching!
