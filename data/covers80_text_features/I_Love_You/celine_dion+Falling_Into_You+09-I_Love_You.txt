 I must be crazy now Maybe I dream too much But when I think of you I long to feel your touch To whisper in your ear Words that I hold as time Words only you'd hear If only you were mine I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes Cause by now I know that you feel the way that I do And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side I, I love you Please say you love me too These three words, they could change our lives forever And I promise you that we will always be together Till the end of time So today I finally find the courage deep inside Just to walk right up to your door But my body can't move when I finally get to it Just like a thousand times before Then without a word he handed me this letter Read I hope this finds the way to your heart It said I love you Please say you love me too These three words, they could change our lives forever And I promise you that we will always be together Till the end of time Maybe I, I need a little love Maybe I, I need a little care Maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you Oh you need somebody just to hold you If you do, just reach out and I'll be there I, I love you Please say you love me too Till the end of time These three words, they could change our lives forever And I promise you that we will always be together Oh, I love you And I love you Please say you love me too Please, please Say you love me too Till the end of time My baby love Together, together forever I love you I will be your light Shining bright, shining through your eyes My baby Staying forever Thank you for watching!
