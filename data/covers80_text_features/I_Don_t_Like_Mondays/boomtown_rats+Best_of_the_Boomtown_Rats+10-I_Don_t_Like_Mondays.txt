 The Silicon Chip Inside of Me, is a great song. I hope you like it. The Silicon Chip Inside her head, gets switched to overload. And nobody's gonna go to school today, she's gonna make them stay at home. And daddy doesn't understand it, he always said she was good as gold. And he can see no reasons, cause there are no reasons. What reason do you need to be sure? Tell me why I don't like Mondays. Tell me why I don't like Mondays. Tell me why I don't like Mondays. I wanna shoot, ooooh, the whole day down. The Tenex machine is kept so clean, and it types to a waiting world. A mother feels so shocked, father's world is rocked, and the thoughts turn to their own little girl. Sweet sixteen ain't that beat-chick-y, now that ain't so neat. To admit defeat, they can see no reasons, cause there are no reasons. What reasons do you need? Tell me why I don't like Mondays. Tell me why I don't like Mondays. Tell me why I don't like Mondays. I wanna shoot, ooooh, the whole day down. Shoot it all down. And now the plane's stopped in the playground now. She wants to play with the toys awhile. And school's out early, and soon we'll be learning, and the lesson today is how to die. And then the bullhorn crackles, and the captain jackals with the brothers, the hounds, and the wives. And he can see no reasons, cause there are no reasons. What reason do you need to die? Die? Oh, oh, oh, oh. And the silicon chip inside her head gets switched to overload. Oh, and nobody's gonna go to school today. She's gonna make them stay at home. And daddy doesn't understand it. He always said she was good as gold. And he can see no reasons, cause there are no reasons. What reason do you need to be sure? Tell me why I don't like Mondays. I wanna shoot the whole day down. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
