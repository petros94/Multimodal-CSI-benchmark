The Last Of Us by The Bumblebee's The Last Of Us plays. The Last Of Us plays. The Last Of Us plays. Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you, that is how I know you, go on. Far across the distance and spaces between us, you have come to show you, go on. Near, far, wherever you are, believe that the heart does go on. Once more, you open the door, here in my heart and my eye will go on and on. Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime and never let go till we're gone. Loves when I love you, once your time I hold too, in my life we'll always go on. Near, far, wherever you are, believe that the heart does go on. Once more, you open the door, here in my heart and my eye will go on and on. Yeah! You're here, there's nothing I fear and I know that my heart will go on. We'll stay forever this way, you're safe in my heart and my eye will go on and on. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Thanks for watching!
