 A dedication to all the refugees worldwide, one time. Say, say, say, I remember when we used to sit in a government yard in Brooklyn. How about solving the crookedness as it mingles with the good people we meet? Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost along the way. In this great future you can't forget your past, so dry your tears, I say, until my peeps who passed away. No woman, no crime. No woman, no crime. Say, say, say, oh, hey, little sister, don't shed no tears. No woman, no crime. Say, say, say, I remember when we used to rock in a project yard in Jersey. And little Georgie would make the fire light and stolen cars pass through the night. And then we'd hit the corner store for roots, paper, and rube. My drapes, my only remedy for pain of losing family. But while I'm gone, shorty, everything is gonna be all right. Everything is gonna be all right. Georgie's come to the dance tonight. Everything is gonna be all right. Everything is gonna be all right. Oh, everything is gonna be all right. The gunman's in the house tonight. But everything is gonna be all right. Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah No woman, no crime No woman, no crime Dear little sister, don't shed no tears No woman, no crime Say, say, say I remember when we used to sit In the government lawn in Trenchtown My Baba saw me, the hypocrite As they mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we had, oh Good friends we've lost Along the way, hey In this great future you can't forget your past So dry your tears, I say And no woman, no crime No woman, no crime Say, say, say Hey little sister, don't shed no tears No woman, no crime I took my peace and passed away Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah www.LRCgenerator.com
