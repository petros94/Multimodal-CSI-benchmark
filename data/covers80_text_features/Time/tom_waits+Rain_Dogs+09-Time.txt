 The smart money's on Harlem, and the moon is in the street, and the shadow boys are breaking all the laws. And you're east of East St. Louis, and the wind is making speeches, and the rain sounds like a round of applause. And Napoleon is weeping, and the carnival's on, his invisible fianc√©'s in the mirror. And the band is going home, it's raining hammers, it's raining nails. It's true, there's nothing left for him down here. And it's time, time, time And it's time, time, time And it's time, time, time that you love And it's time, time, time And they all pretend they're orphans And their memory's like a train You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away And the things you can't remember Tell the things you can't forget The history puts a saint in every dream Well, she said she'd stick around Until the bandages came off But these mama's boys just don't know when to quit And Matilda asked the sailors All those dreams are all those prayers So close your eyes, son, and this won't hurt a bit Oh, it's time, time, time And it's time, time, time And it's time, time, time that you love And it's time, time, time Well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl The boys just dive right off the cars and splash into the street And when they're on a roll, she pulls a razor from her boot And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet So put a candle in the window and a kiss upon his lips As the dish outside the window fills with rain Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart and paint a feather off till I come back again. Oh it's time, time, time. It's time, time, time. And it's time, time, time that you love. And it's time, time, time. And it's time, time, time... Thanks for watching!
