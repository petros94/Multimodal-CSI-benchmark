 Where did your long hair go? Where is the girl I used to know? How could you lose that happy glow? Oh, Carolina, oh, Carolina Who took that look away? I remember how you used to say You'd never change, but that's not true Oh, Carolina, you break my heart I don't wanna go and cry It's so sad to watch you sleeping by Oh, Carolina Could I ever find in you again Things that made me love you so much then Could we ever bring them back once they have gone? Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina Oh, Carolina you Thank you.
