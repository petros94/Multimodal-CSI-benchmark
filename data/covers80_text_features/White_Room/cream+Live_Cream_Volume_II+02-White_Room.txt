 In the white room of the midnight club, oh, yeah, that's the truth. Black clothes, coffee, no more pills, tired starlet. Silver heart, and loud loud music in the dark night. She just said goodbye, oh, tired starlet. And I wait in this place where the sun never shines. Wait in this place where the shadows fall on us, no. You said no, no cigarettes at the station. Black coffee, Christmas diesel, you're my one thing. And my walk is like a fashion at the station. As I walk down Selma Road, just seeking it. And I wait in the queue where the train comes. I wait in the queue where the shadows run from the sun. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Black coffee, he was kinder. Consolation for the old man, now for the young. Yellow tiger crossing jungle in her dark eyes. She just said goodbye, oh, tired starlet. And I wait in this place where the sun never shines. I wait in the queue where the shadows run from the sun. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
