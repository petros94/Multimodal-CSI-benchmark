 I may not always love you, but long as there are stars above you, You never need to doubt it, I'll make you so sure about it, And God only knows what I'd be without you. If you should ever leave me, could life still go on, believe me, The world could show nothing to me, so what good would living do me, God only knows what I'd be without you. My God only knows what I'd be without you. If you should ever leave me, life was too good, unbelieve me. The world could show nothing to me, so what good would living do me? My God only knows what I'd be without you. My God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows. Thank you very much. Great. I don't know if any of you have had any deaths in your family, or someone dies in your family. Well, I lost my brother Carl a couple years ago. He was quite a great guy. And so I'm going to dedicate this song to any of you who had a death in your family, and to my brother Carl Wilson.
