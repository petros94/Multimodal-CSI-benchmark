 So, I'm going to play a little bit of it. So, I'm going to play a little bit of it. Turn off your mind, relax to go downstream. It is not dying, it is not dying. Lay down on the porch, surrender to the void. It is shining, oh it is shining. Can't you see the meaning of living? It is being, oh it is being. And love is all, and love is everyone. It is knowing, oh it is knowing. And ignorance and hate belong to the dead. It is believing, it is believing. So, play the game, existence to the end. And love begins, and love begins. And love begins, and love begins. And love begins, and love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins. And love begins.
