 Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream. This is not dying. Lay down, surrender to the voice. It is shining. That you may see the meaning of within. It is being. It is being. That love is all. That love is everyone. It is knowing. That ignorance and hate lay on the ground. It is believing. But listen to the colour of your dreams. It is not living. Or play the game existence to the end. Of the beginning. The End.
