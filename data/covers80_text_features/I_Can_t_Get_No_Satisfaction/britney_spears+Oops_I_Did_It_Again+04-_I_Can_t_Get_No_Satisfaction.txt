 La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la. I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction. And I try and I try and I try and I try. I can't get no satisfaction. When I'm driving in my car and that man comes on the radio. He's telling me more and more about some useless information. Supposed to follow my imagination. I can't get no, I know, know, I know. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. And this is what I say. I can't get no satisfaction. I can't get no reaction. And I try and I try and I try and I try, babe. I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction. When I'm watching my TV and that girl comes on and tells me how tight my skirt should be. But she can't tell me who to be, babe. She got my head, yeah, daddy. I can't get no, I know, know, I know. I can't get no satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction. And I try and I try and I try and I try. I just can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction. No, no, no. I can't get no satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction. No, I can't get no, no. I can't get no satisfaction. I need no satisfaction. I can't get no, no, no, baby. Satisfaction. I can't get no. No matter what I do, no matter what I say. Everywhere I go, they say I'm okay. No matter what I do, no matter what I say. Everywhere I go, they say I'm okay. I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction. I'm satisfied with what I say. I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction, baby. Bye. ...
