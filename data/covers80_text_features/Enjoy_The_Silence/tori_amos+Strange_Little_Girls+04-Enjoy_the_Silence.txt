 Words like violence break the silence Come crashing in into my little world Painful to me, pierce right through me Can't you understand, oh my little girl All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms Vows are spoken to be broken Feelings are intense, words are trivial Pleasures remain, so does the pain Words are meaningless and unforgettable All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms Words are very unnecessary They can only do harm Words like violence break the silence Come crashing in into my little world Painful to me, pierce right through me Can't you understand, oh my little girl All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms Vows are spoken to be broken Feelings are intense, words are trivial Pleasures remain, so does the pain Words are meaningless and forgettable All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms Words are very unnecessary They can only do harm Can only do harm Thanks for watching!
