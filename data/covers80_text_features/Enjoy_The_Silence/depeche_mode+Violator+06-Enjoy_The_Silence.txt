 🎵 Music 🎵 Words like violence break the silence Come crashing in, into my little world Painful to me, it's right through me Don't you understand, oh my little girl All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here, in my arms Words are very unnecessary, breaking only to harm 🎵 Music 🎵 Vows are spoken, to be broken, feelings untamed, words are trivial Pleasures remain, so does the pain, words are meaningless and forgettable All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here, in my arms Words are very unnecessary, breaking only to harm 🎵 Music 🎵 All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here, in my arms Words are very unnecessary, breaking only to harm All I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here, in my arms Words are very unnecessary, breaking only to harm 🎵 Music 🎵 Words are very unnecessary, breaking only to harm 🎵 Music 🎵 Enjoy the silence 🎵 Music 🎵 🎵 Music 🎵 🎵 Music 🎵 🎵 Music 🎵 🎵 Music 🎵 you
