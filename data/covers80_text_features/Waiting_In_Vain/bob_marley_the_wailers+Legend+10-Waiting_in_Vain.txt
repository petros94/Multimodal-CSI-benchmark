 One, two, one, two, three, four. I don't wanna wait, can't wait for your love. From the very first time I glanced my eyes at you, girl. My heart says follow through. But I know now that I'm way down on your line. But the way you feel is fine. So don't treat me like a puppet on a string. Cause I know how to do my thing. Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb. I wanna know when you're gonna come. I don't wanna wait, can't wait for your love. Cause it's summer this year. I'm still waiting there. It's winter this year. And I'm still waiting there. Like I said, it's been three years since I'm knocking on your door. And I still can't knock some more. Ooh girl, ooh girl, is it feasible? I wanna know now, for I to knock some more. Yeah see, in life I know there's lots of grief. But your love is my relief. Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn. While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn. See, I don't wanna wait, can't wait for your love. I don't wanna wait, can't wait for your love. I don't wanna wait in vain. It's your love that I'm waiting on. I don't wanna wait in vain. I don't wanna wait in vain.
