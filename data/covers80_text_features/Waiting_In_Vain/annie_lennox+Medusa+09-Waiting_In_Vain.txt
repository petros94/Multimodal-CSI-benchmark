 From the very first time I rest my eyes on you But my heart said false rules But I know now that I'm way down on your line But the waiting feeling's fine So don't treat me like a puppet on the street Cause I know how to do my thing Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb I wanna know when you're gonna come and see But I don't wanna wait in vain for your love But summer is here, I'm still waiting there Winter is here, I'm still waiting there Like I said, it's been three years since I'm knocking on your door And I still can knock some more Ooh, boy, ooh, boy, is it crazy? Look, I wanna know now For I to knock some more You see, in life I know that there is lots of grief But your love is my relief Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my day See, I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love Cause summer is here, I'm still waiting there Winter is here, I'm still waiting there Like I said, I don't wanna wait in vain I don't wanna wait in vain It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door And I still can knock some more Is it crazy, no, I wanna know now Like I said, I don't wanna wait in vain Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn See, I don't wanna wait in vain for your love Is it crazy, no, I wanna know now For I too love summer And I know there is lots of grief But your love is my relief ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ you you
