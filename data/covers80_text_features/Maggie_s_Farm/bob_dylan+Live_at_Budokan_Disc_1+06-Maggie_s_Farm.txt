 ♪♪♪ I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more I wake up in the morning, hold my hands in paper rakes And a handful of ideas that are driving me insane It's a shame in a way she makes me scrub the floor ♪♪♪♪ I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime Asks you if you're feeling all right, you're having a good time And he finds you every time you slam the door ♪♪♪♪ I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more Talked to so many about man and God and law Everybody says he's the brains behind his ma 68% he's teddy bear ♪♪♪♪ I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more And she puts her cigar right in my face just for kicks Her brand new window is made out of bricks And there's no God's hand around his door ♪♪♪♪ I ain't gonna work or make a spot no more I try my best to be just like I am Everybody wants you to be just like them They say sing while you slay, I get bored ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ Thank you. That was called Maggie's Farm. ♪♪♪♪
