 Old Man Lying by the side of the road, the floor is rolling by Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load and the buildings scrape the sky Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn and the morning paper flies Dead man lying by the side of the road with the daylight in his eyes Don't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning Find someone who's turning and you will come around Blind man running through the light of the night with an answer in his hand Come on down to the river of sight and you can really understand Red lines flashing through the window in the rain and you hear the sirens moan White cane lying in a gutter in the lane, if you're walking home alone Don't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning Find someone who's turning and you will come around Don't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning Just find someone who's turning and you will come around Don't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning Just find someone who's turning and you will come around Thanks for watching!
