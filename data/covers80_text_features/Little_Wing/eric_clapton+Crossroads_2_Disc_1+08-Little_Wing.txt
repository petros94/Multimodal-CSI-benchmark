 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She's walking through the clouds. With a circus mind that's whirling round. Butterflies and zebras and fairy tales. When I say, when I say, she comes to me. With a smile that she keeps to me free. Saying it's alright. Do anything you want to baby. Do anything you want to baby. Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh you you
