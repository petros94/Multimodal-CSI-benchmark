 One day I seen a strange little girl like you. One day I seen a strange little girl feeling blue. She run to the town one day leaving home and her country fell. Just beware when you're there, strange little girl. She didn't know how to live in a town that was rough. It didn't take long before she knew she'd had enough. Walking home in a wrapped up world she survived but she's feeling old. Cause she found all things cold. Strange little girl where are you going? Strange little girl you know, alright you should be going. I know you can't choose. I know, I know. One day I see a strange little girl like you. One day I see a strange little girl feeling blue. Walking home in a wrapped up world she survived but she's feeling old. Cause she found all things cold. Strange little girl where are you going? Strange little girl you know, alright you should be going. Strange little girl where are you going? Strange little girl you know, alright you should be going. Strange little girl where are you going? Strange little girl you know, alright you should be going. Thank you for watching!
