 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! We like that! Lady, when you're with me I'm smiling Give me all your love Your hands build me up when I'm sinking Just touch me and my troubles all fade Lady, from the moment I saw you Standing all alone You gave all the love that I needed So shine like a child you have grown You're my lady of the morning Love shines in your eyes Swirl me, clear and lovely You're my lady Oh lady, turn me on when I'm lonely Show me a role of your charms Even when you lay down beside me Just take me gently into your arms You're my lady of the morning Love shines in your eyes Swirl me, clear and lovely You're my lady Oh lady, of the morning Love shines in your eyes Swirl me, clear and lovely You're my lady Thank you! www.LRCgenerator.com
