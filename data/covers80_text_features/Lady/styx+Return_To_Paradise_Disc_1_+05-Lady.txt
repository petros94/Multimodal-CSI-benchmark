 I was sitting in my garage at a little Wurlitzer electric piano this song popped out and started this whole train a-rollin Lady, when you're with me I'm smiling Give me all your love Your hands build me up when I'm sinking Just touch me and my troubles are fading Lady, from the moment I saw you Standing all alone You gave all the love that I needed She's so shy, like a child who had no You're my lady of the morning Love shines in your eyes Smiling, clear and lovely You're my lady Lady, turns me on when I'm lonely She shows me all of her heart shines Even when she lays down beside me She takes me gently into her arms She's my lady of the morning Love shines in your eyes Smiling, clear and lovely You're my lady Lady of the morning Love shines in your eyes Smiling, clear and lovely You're my lady Thank you for watching!
