 I could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away and dreaming I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep Cause I'll miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing Even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do I still miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing Am I close to you? Can you feel your heart beating? And I'm wondering what you're dreaming I'm wondering if it's me you're seeing Can I kiss your eyes? Thank God we're together I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep Cause I'll miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing Even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do I still miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing I don't wanna miss one smile I don't wanna miss one kiss I just wanna be with you right here with you Just like this I just wanna hold you close To get one too close to mine And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep Cause I'll miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing Even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do I still miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing I still miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing Yeah, yeah, yeah I still miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You you
