 I can turn the grey sky blue And I can make it rain whenever I wanted to And I can build a castle for my single grandson And I can make a ship sail on dry land But my life isn't complete and I'm so blue Cause I can't get next to you I can't get next to you babe I can't get next to you I can't get next to you babe No, I can't get next to you I can fly like a bird in the sky Like a bird in a bay when the morning comes by I can turn a river into a raging fire I can live forever if I so desire But I don't want all these things I can do Cause I can't get next to you I can't get next to you babe I can't get next to you I can't get next to you babe I can't get next to you No, I can't get next to you babe No, I can't get next to you I can turn back the hands of time and never leave again I can make the seasons change just by the way that my hands move I can change anything from one to the moon The thing I want to do the most I'm unable to do I'm an unhappy woman with all the powers I possess Cause man, you're the key to my happiness Cause I can't get next to you Ooh, you're blowing my mind Cause I can't get next to you Can't you see these tears I'm crying I can't get next to you Oh, to lose and I bleed I gotta get next to you Can't you see these tears I'm crying I can't get next to you I, I, I, I, I, I can't get next to you you
