 I've squandered my resistance For a pocket full of mumbles Such are promises All lies and jests Still a man who hears what he wants to hear And disregards the rest When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy In the company of strangers In the quiet of the railway station Running scared Laying alone Seeking out the poorer quarters Where the ragged people go Looking for the places only money can go Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job But I get no offers Just to come on from the horizontal avenue I do declare There were times when I was so lost But I never took some comfort there Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la Then I'm laying out my winter clothes, wishing I was going home Where the New York City winters are bleeding me Bleeding me, going home In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down Cut him to the cry that in his anger and his shame Well I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains, he still remains La la la, la la la la la la... La la la, la la la la la la... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
