 I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told. I squander my resistance for a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises. All lies and jests, till the man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest. When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy in the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railway station, let him scare. Lame and old, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go, looking for the faces only they will know. Lie, lie, lie... Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job, but I get no offers, just to come home from the wars on Seventh Avenue. I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there. Lie, lie, lie... Lyrics by E.S.S. Lie, lie, lie... And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone, gone, gone, where the New York City winters are bleeding me, bleeding me, gone, gone. At the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade and he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame. I am leaving, I am leaving, but the island still remains. Lie, lie, lie... Lie, lie, lie... Lie, lie, lie... Lie, lie, lie... Lie, lie, lie... Lie, lie, lie... Lie, lie, lie... Lie, lie, lie...
