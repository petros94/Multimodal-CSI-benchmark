 I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body I know not everybody has got a body like me But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away And I know all the games you play, cause I play them too Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion Time to kick my heart up off the floor When that love comes down without the devotion Well, it takes a strong man, baby, but I'm I'm showing you that door, right? Gotta have faith, gotta have faith, gotta have faith, gotta have faith Baby, I know you're asking me to stay Say, please, please, please don't go away Cause you're giving me the blues Baby, you might be all that's worth to stay Can't help but think of yesterday And another who tied me down to the love of my life Before this river becomes an ocean Before you kick my heart up off the floor When that love comes down without devotion Well, it takes a strong man, baby, but I'm I'm showing you that door, right? Gotta have faith, gotta have faith, gotta have faith, gotta have faith Get the fuck up! I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith Get the fuck up! I gotta have faith! I gotta have faith! I gotta have faith! Am I a freak in the darkness, or am I a misfit? You speak of opinions to sink in so deep, but it's alright You're just an illusion, confused by your narrow mind Reality is up ahead in the distance But that lack of persistence has left you behind And you're reaching for your sanity Cause you're afraid of me, so don't fuck with me You wanna ask me a question? Well, I got a question How much longer can I tolerate this shit? Egos trip when you're living on the flip side Drop out of a uterus and die, damn I see a point in your finger You stereotype me cause you don't like me Well, you don't even know me You don't know me You don't know me You stereotype me cause you don't like me You don't know me Oh, like me, oh, like me, oh, like me, oh, like me
