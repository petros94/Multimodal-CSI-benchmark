 You've got the cool water when the fever runs high And you've got the look of love right in your eyes And I was in a crazy motion till you calmed me down It took a little time but you calmed me down Some people never say the words I love you It's not their style to be so bold Some people never say the words I love you But like a child they're longing to be told They've got a wall in China, it's a thousand miles long To keep out the foreigners they made it strong And I've got a wall all around me that you can't even see It took a little time to get next to me When something goes wrong I'm the first to admit it The first to admit it, the last one to know When something goes right, oh well it's likely to lose me It's hard to confuse me because it's such an unusual sight I can't get used to something so right, to something so right Some people never say the words I love you It's not their style to be so bold Some people never say the words I love you But like a child I'm longing to be told They've got a wall in China Mmm, yeah And I've got a wall all around me, yeah, yeah It took a little time to get next to me When something goes right, oh well it's likely to lose me It's hard to confuse me because it's such an unusual sight I can't get used to something so right, to something so right Some people never say the words I love you It's not their style to be so bold
