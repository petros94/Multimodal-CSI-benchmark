 You got the cool water When the fever runs high You got the look of love light in your eyes And I was in crazy motion Till you calmed me down It took a little time But you calmed me down When something goes wrong I'm the first to admit it I'm the first to admit it And the last one to know When something goes right Oh, it's likely to lose me It's apt to confuse me It's such an unusual sight Oh, I can't, I can't get used to something so right Something so right They got a wall in China It's a thousand miles long To keep out the foreigners They made it strong And I got a wall around me That you can't even see It took a little time To get next to me When something goes wrong I'm the first to admit it I'm the first to admit it And the last one to know When something goes right Oh, it's likely to lose me It's apt to confuse me It's such an unusual sight Oh, I can't, I can't get used to something so right Something so right Some people never say the words I love you It's not their style To be so bold Some people never say those words I love you But like a child They're longing to be told When something goes wrong I'm the first to admit it I'm the first to admit it And the last one to know When something goes right Oh, it's likely to lose me It's apt to confuse me It's such an unusual sight Oh, I can't, I can't get used to something so right Something so right Something so right Something so right .
