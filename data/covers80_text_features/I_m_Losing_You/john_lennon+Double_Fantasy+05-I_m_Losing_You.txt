 Here in some stranger's room Late in the afternoon What am I doing here at all? Ain't no doubt about it I'm losing you I'm losing you Somehow the wires have crossed Communication lost Can't even get you on the telephone Just gotta shout about it I'm losing you I'm losing you Here in the valley of indecision I don't know what to do I feel you slipping away I feel you slipping away I'm losing you I'm losing you Well now, you say you're not getting enough But I remind you of all that bad, bad, bad stuff So what the hell am I supposed to do? Just put a band-aid on it And stop the bleeding now Stop the bleeding now Yeah! Woo! Woo! I'm losing you I'm losing you Well, well, well I know I hurt you then For a hell that was way back when Well, do you still have to carry that cross? Drop it! Don't wanna hear about it I'm losing you I'm losing you Don't wanna lose you now Oh! Well, don't Don't Don't
