 Here in some strange room Late in the afternoon, What am I doing here at all? Ain't no doubt about it, I'm losing you, I'm losing you. Somehow the wires have crossed, Communication's lost, Can't even get you on the telephone. Ain't no doubt about it, I'm losing you, I'm losing you. Terrible hallelujah season, I don't know what to do, I think you're slipping away, I think you're slipping away. I'm losing you, I'm losing you. You say you're not getting enough, But I remind you of all that bad, bad stuff, So what the hell am I supposed to do? Just throw the band-aid on it, And stop the bleeding now, Stop the bleeding now. I'm losing you, I'm losing you. Terrible hallelujah season, I don't know what to do, I think you're slipping away, I think you're slipping away. Stop the bleeding now, Stop the bleeding now. I know I hurt you then, Hell, that was way back when, Do you still have to carry that cross? Don't wanna hear about it, I'm losing you, I'm losing you. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Thank you.
