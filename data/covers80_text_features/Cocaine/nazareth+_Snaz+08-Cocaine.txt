The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... The word is... And if you wanna go out, you got to know she's about cocaine. And if you don't wanna get down, down on the ground. She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie. She'll give you a cap and a noose, you got to kick your blues, cocaine. And if you think you've done what you've done, you just gotta run on, cocaine. She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie. Cocaine! Cocaine! Cocaine! Cocaine! Cocaine! Cocaine! Cocaine! You think you've done what you've done, you just gotta run on, cocaine. But don't forget this fact, you just can't get it back, cocaine. She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie. Cocaine! She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie. Cocaine! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
