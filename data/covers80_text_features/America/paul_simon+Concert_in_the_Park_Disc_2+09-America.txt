 Let Us Be Lovers by The Bachelors plays. Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together. I've got some real estate here in my bag. So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies, and we walked off to look for America. Coffee I said as we boarded a plane out to Pittsburgh. Michigan seems like a dream to me now. It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw, and I have come to look for America. Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces. She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy. I said be careful, his bow tie is really a camera. Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat. We smoked the last one an hour ago. So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazines, and the moon rose over an open field. Cathy I'm lost I said, though I knew she was sleeping. I'm empty and I'm aching and I don't know why. Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike, they've all come to look for America. All come to look for America. All come to look for America. All come to look for America. Thank you.
