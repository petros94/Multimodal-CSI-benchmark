 I've seen my way, I have to keep on talking till I can't go on What I see in your way, is annoying that I may soon be gone We can work it out, we can work it out People want to say, it's wrong, it's stupid, it's alright People want to say, work it out and get it straight, don't say goodnight We can work it out, we can work it out Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again Try seeing my way, don't tell me I'm right or I am wrong What I see in your way, just a queen by far apart before too long We can work it out, we can work it out Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again Try seeing my way, don't tell me I'm right or I am wrong What I see in your way, just a queen by far apart before too long We can work it out, we can work it out you you
