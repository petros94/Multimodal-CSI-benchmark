 Try to see it my way, do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? While you see it your way, run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone We can work it out, we can work it out Think of what you're saying, you can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright Think of what I'm saying, we can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight We can work it out, we can work it out Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again Try to see it my way, only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong While you see it your way, there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long We can work it out, we can work it out Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again Try to see it my way, only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong While you see it your way, there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long We can work it out, we can work it out Thanks for watching!
