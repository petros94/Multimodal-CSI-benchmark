Give it to me straight from the heart Tell me we can make another start You know I'd never go in on your sandals But it's straight from the heart Yeah! Give it to me straight from the heart Tell me we can make another start You know I'd never go as long as I know It's coming straight from the heart Oh, you know I'd never go as long as I know It's straight from the heart Straight, straight from the heart You know I'd never go as long as I know It's coming straight from the heart Yeah!
