 I could start dreaming but it never ends As long as you're gone we may as well pretend I've been dreaming straight from the heart You say it's easy but who's to say That we'd be able to keep it this way But it's easier coming straight from the heart Oh, give it to me straight from the heart Tell me we can make another start You know I'll never go As long as I know it's coming straight from the heart I see you on the street some other time And all our words would just fall out of line While we're dreaming straight from the heart Oh, give it to me straight from the heart Tell me we can make one more start You know I'll never go As long as I know it's coming straight from the heart Oh, you know I'll never go Oh, straight from the heart Tell me we can make one more start You know I'll never go As long as I know it's coming straight from the heart Oh, give it to me straight from the heart Tell me we can make one more start You know I'll never go As long as I know it's coming straight from the heart Oh, straight from the heart You know I'll never go As long as I know it's coming straight from the heart You know I'll never go As long as I know it's coming straight from the heart
