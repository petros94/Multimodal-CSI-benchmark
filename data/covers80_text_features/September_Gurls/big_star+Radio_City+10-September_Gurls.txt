 So tell the girls, they said a lot I was your butch, and you were touch I loved you, well, never mind I've been crying all the time Sometimes a boy's got it bad Sometimes a boy's got it bad So tell them, girls, I don't know why How can I deny what's inside? Even though I'll keep away With very little love all our days Sometimes a boy's got it bad Sometimes a boy's got it bad When I get too bad, night after night Last of the time, she makes me cry Oh, and she likes it hard to leave So tell the girls, they said a lot I was your butch, and you were touch I loved you, well, never mind I've been crying all the time Sometimes a boy's got it bad Sometimes a boy's got it bad So tell them, girls, I don't know why How can I deny what's inside? Thanks for watching!
