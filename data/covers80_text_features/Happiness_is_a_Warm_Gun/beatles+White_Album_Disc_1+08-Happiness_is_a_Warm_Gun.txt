 She's not a girl who misses much Do-do-do-do-do-do Oh yeah She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand Like a lizard on a windowpane A man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors on his half-nailed boots Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust I need a fix cos I'm going down Down to the bits that I left uptown I need a fix cos I'm going down Mother Superior jumped the gun Mother Superior jumped the gun Mother Superior jumped the gun Mother Superior jumped the gun Mother Superior jumped the gun Mother Superior jumped the gun Happiness is a warm gun Back, back to the chute Happiness is a warm gun, mama Back, back to the chute When I hold you in my arms And I feel my finger on your trigger I know nobody can do me no harm Because Happiness is a warm gun, mama Back, back to the chute Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is Back, back to the chute Happiness is a warm, yes it is Gun Happiness Back, back to the chute Don't you know that happiness Is a warm gun, mama Is a warm gun, yeah you .
