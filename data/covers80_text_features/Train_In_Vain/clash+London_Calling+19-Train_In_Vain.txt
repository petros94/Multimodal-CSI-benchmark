 You say you stand by your man Tell me something I don't understand You said you loved lots of eyes And then you left me to trip the track Well, some things you can't explain away But the heartache should be filled with the pain And you stand by me, you love it all And you stand by me, you go away All the time, you're on the coast I remember this place the most I see all my dreams come tumbling down I can't be happy without you around So alone I pick the rules and face And there's only one thing I can say You can stand by me, you love it all And you stand by me, you go away You must explain why this must be Did you lie when you spoke to me? You stand by me, you love it all Now I've got a job, but it's on pay I need new clothes, I need someone to stay But without all of these things I can't do Without your love, I'll make it through But you don't understand my point of view I suppose there's nothing I can do And you stand by me, you love it all And you stand by me, you go away You stand by me, you love it all And you stand by me, you go away You must explain why this must be Did you lie when you spoke to me? You stand by me You stand by me, you love it all You stand by me, you go away You stand by me, you love it all You stand by me, you go away You stand by me, you love it all You stand by me, you love it all You stand by me, you love it all You stand by me, you go away You stand by me, you love it all You stand by me, you love it all Thank you.
