Me and some guys from school Had a bad and we tried real hard Jamie quit and Jodie got married Should've known we'd never get far But when I look back now This love I see lasts forever And if I had a choice Yeah, I always wanna be there Those were the best days of my life Ain't no use in complaining When you got a job to do Spend my evening down at the drive-in And that's when I met you, hey Standing on your mama's porch You told me that you'd wait forever And when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never Those were the best days of my life Oh yeah Back in the summer of 69 Man, we were getting tired We were young and reckless We needed to hide I guess nothing can last forever Forever Oh! And now the times are changing Looking ever since Calvin gone Sometimes when I play my old six string Think about you, wonder what we're not Standing on your mama's porch You told me that you'd wait forever And when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never Those were the best days of my life Oh yeah Back in the summer of 69 Hey It was the summer of 69 Oh yeah Just me and my baby in 69 Summer, summer, summer of 69 Summer, summer, summer of 69 Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Blind love, it's the worst thing in the world Blind love, it's a killing gun blind love, it's a killing gun Thank you very very much!
