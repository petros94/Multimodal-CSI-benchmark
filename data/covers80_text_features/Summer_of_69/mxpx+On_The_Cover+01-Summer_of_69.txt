 I got my first real sex change, bought it at the five-inch dime Played it till my fingers bled, was a summer of 69 Me and some guys from school, had a band and we tried real hard Didn't quit, joy unmarried, I should've known, we'd never get far Oh, where do they rank now? This song might seem to last forever And if I had a choice, yeah, if there was one I'd be there Those were the best days of my life Ain't no use in complaining, when you got a job to do Playing next town after driving, no one heard you Standing on your daddy's voice, you told me that you'd wait forever And you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never Those were the best days of my life Began a summer of 69 We were killing time, we were young and restless, we needed to unwind I guess nothing could last forever, forever now And now times are changing, look at everything that's come and gone Sometimes when I play a little sex change, think about you and what went wrong Standing on your daddy's voice, you told me that you'd wait forever And you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never Those were the best days of my life Began a summer of 69 Began a summer of 69 Began a summer of 69 Began a summer of 69 Began a summer of 69 Began a summer of 69 Thanks for watching! you ...
