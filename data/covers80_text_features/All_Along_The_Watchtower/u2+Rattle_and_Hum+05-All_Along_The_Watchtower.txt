 You You You You You You You You You You You There must be some way out of here Said the Joker to the thief There's too much confusion here I can't get no relief This man better drink my wine Wild man dig my earth None of them know I love the night What in the name of this is worth? Yeah! No reason to get excited I think they kindly spoke There are many among us Who think that life is but a joke But you and I, we've been through that And that is not our fate So let us not talk spokely now Because the hour is getting late Yeah! All along the white tower Empresses kept the view Wild hearted men became aware Therefore they said the truth All I got is a red guitar Three chords and the truth All I got is a red guitar The rest is up to you No reason to get excited I think they kindly spoke Some among us here say that life is just a joke But you and I, we've been through that And that is not our fate At least today So let us not talk spokely now Because the hour is getting late Late! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Thank you. you
