 **Applause** **Music** **Music** There must be some way outta here Send the joker to the deep There's too much confusion I can't get no relief Desperately drink my wine The foul men take my herb Gotta live a local life For what it is in this world **Music** No reason to get excited But TV kindly spoke There are many here among us Who feel that life is but a joke But you and I we've been through this And this is not our fate So let us not talk falsely now Our escape is late **Music** All on watch time But there's captive youth While all the women came and went Barefoot servants too Outside the airy distance The fire catches cold The runners were approaching The wind began to howl **Music** **Applause**
