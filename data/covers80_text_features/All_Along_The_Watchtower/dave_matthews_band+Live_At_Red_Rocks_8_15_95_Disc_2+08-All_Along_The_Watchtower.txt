 ðŸŽµMusicðŸŽµ There must be some kind of way out of here Send the jokers to the heat Do you mind this confusion? I can't get no relief There's no smell in my wine I'm plumbing into my heart None of them are lonely like No one in the other's world No reason to get excited But be fair and kind, let's hope There are many here among us Who feel life is part of them But you and I, we will build all that It's okay, oh, and this is not a phase So let us not talk falsely now The hour is getting late Oh, they don't know what's coming Princess, get a little hue When all the women, all the women, all the women Even the well-bred ones stood and stood Outside in the cold distance They were hanging round The line that I drew I was approaching my wedding day too Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, they don't know what's coming Princess, get a little hue When all the women came running round Barefoot and still Outside in the cold distance See, while you get to ground I was right, I was right, I was approaching The well-bred ones too Ah! I miss her, I miss her You always have to get excited Thank you all very much, God bless you again Bye! Thank you, I'm John Reynolds, I'm a guitar. Cheerio, bye! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! ... ...
