Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Suddenly everything goes back and forth. I'm not in love, so don't forget it. It's just a silly phase I'm going to. And just because I call you up, don't get it wrong. Don't think you got it right. I'm not in love, no, it's because. I said I'd like to see you, but then again, it doesn't mean, it means much to me. So if I call you here, don't make a voice. Don't tell your friends about me too. I'm not in love, no, it's because. I keep your picture up on the wall. It hides a nasty stain still lying there. It hides a nasty stain still lying there. I keep your picture up on the wall. It hides a nasty stain still lying there. It hides a nasty stain still lying there. So don't you ask me to keep your picture up. I know you know it doesn't mean much to me. I'm not in love, no, it's because. So wait a long time for me. So wait a long time, wait a long time for me. So wait a long time, wait a long time for me. I'm not in love, so don't look here. It's just a silly face I'm going to do. And just because I call you up. Don't get me wrong, don't think you can get me. I'm not in love, I'm not in love. So wait a long time, wait a long time for me. So wait a long time, wait a long time for me. So wait a long time, wait a long time for me. you Thank you.
