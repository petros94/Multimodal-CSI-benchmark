 Love Us by The Prodigal Song Love hurts, love's gone, love wounds in more than it hurts Not tough or strong, enough to take a lot of pain Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain Love hurts, ooh, love hurts I'm young, I know, but even tough I'm nothing but you, did I learn from you I really learned a lot, I really learned a lot Love is like a flame, burns you when it's hot Love hurts, ooh, love hurts Some fools think of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness Some fools fool themselves, I guess they're not fooling me I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true Love is just a lie, made to make you blue Love hurts, ooh, love hurts Ooh, love hurts I know it isn't true I know it isn't true, love is just a lie Made to make you blue Love hurts, ooh, love hurts Ooh, love hurts Ooh, love hurts Thank you for watching!
