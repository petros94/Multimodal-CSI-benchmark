I'm young, I know, but even so I know a thing or two. I learned from you, I really learned a lot, I really learned a lot. Love is like a flame, it burns you when it's hot. Love hurts. Ooooo, love hurts. Some who dream of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness. Some who fool themselves, I guess, will tell you that it's real. But I know, I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true. Love is like a plot laid to make you blue. Love hurts. Ooooo, love hurts. Ooooo, love hurts. Ooooo, love hurts. Thank you. We have a really good friend of ours helping us on backup vocals tonight, Kristen Berry.
