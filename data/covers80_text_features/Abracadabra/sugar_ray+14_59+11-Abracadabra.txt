 I'm gonna get you! I hate up, I can't cool down You got me spinning round and round, round and round and round it goes. Where it stops, nobody knows. Every time you call my name, I heat up like a burning flame. Burning flame, full of desire. Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher. Abracadabra, I wanna reach out and grab ya. Abracadabra, abracadabra. You make me hot, you make me sigh. You make me laugh, you make me cry. Keep me burning for your love, with the touch of a velvet glove. Abracadabra, I wanna reach out and grab ya. Abracadabra, abracadabra. I feel the magic in your caress. I feel magic when I touch your dress. Silk and satin, leather and laces. Black panties with an angel face. I see magic in your eyes. I hear magic in your sighs. Just when I think I'm gonna get away, I hear those words that you always say. Abracadabra, abracadabra. I wanna reach out and grab ya. Abracadabra, abracadabra. Every time you call my name, I heat up like a burning flame. Burning flame, full of desire. Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Abracadabra, abracadabra. Abracadabra, abracadabra. Abracadabra, abracadabra. Abracadabra, abracadabra. Abracadabra, abracadabra. Abracadabra, abracadabra. I heat up, I can't cool down. My situation goes. I heat up, I can't cool down. My situation goes. I heat up, I can't cool down. My situation goes. you Thank you.
