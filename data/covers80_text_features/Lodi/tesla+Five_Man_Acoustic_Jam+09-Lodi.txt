 Just about a year ago I set out on the road Seeking out fame and fortune Looking for a pile of gold A place I've been, a place I've worked I guess you know the truth But Lord, I'm stuck in a road I can't get through I'm holding on to prayer And I'm a-walking that final road I was just passing through It must have been seven months or more I ran out of time that morning It looks like I took a break Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a road I can't get through I ran from the magazine He said I was on my way Somewhere I lost connection I ran out of songs to play And in time the one that's there It looks like my plans fell through Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a road I can't get through If I had a million dollars For every song I sung Every time I had to wait While people sat their turn No, I don't care to next train I'm back to where I'm at Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a road I can't get through Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a road I can't get through Thank you for watching!
