 Just about a year ago, I sat out on the road Seeking my favorite fortune, looking for a pint of gold The things I paid and the things I learned, I guess you know the tune Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten I rode in a horny greyhound, I'll be walking out if I go I was just a pacer, must be seven months or more I ran out of time and money, look like I took my friend Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten A man from the magazine said I was on my way Somewhere I lost connection, I ran out of songs to play I came in the town of one nice man, look like my friend fell through Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten Well if I only had a dollar, would I ever have something I'd show Every time I had a play, my people sat their broom down You know I'd catch the next train back to where I live Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a low down kindergarten Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
