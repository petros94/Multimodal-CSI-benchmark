 I don't know why I'm loving like I do All the changes you've been through I take my money, my cigarettes I haven't seen the worst of it yet I wanna know, can you tell me I really love to stay Take me to the river, drop me in the water Take me to the river, dip me in the water Washin' me down, washin' me down, washin' me down, washin' me down I don't know why the dream is so bad Think of all the things that we could have had Love is an ocean and I can't forget My sweet sixteen, I'll never break I wanna know, can you tell me I really love to stay Take me to the river, drop me in the water Take me to the river, dip me in the water Love me, squeeze me, love me, tease me Till I can't, till I can't, till I can't, till I can't I don't know why I'm loving like I do All the trouble you put me through Sixteen candles blowing on the wall And here I am, the biggest fool of all I wanna know, can you tell me I really love to stay Take me to the river, drop me in the water Dip me in the water, drop me in the river Wash me in the water, drop me in the river Thanks for watching!
