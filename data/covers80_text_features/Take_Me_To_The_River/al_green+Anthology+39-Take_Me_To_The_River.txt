 I'd like to dedicate this song to Junior Park, a cousin of mine that's gone off, but we'd better carry on in his name. After all the changes that you put me through, used all my money and my cigarette, and I haven't seen how to have you yet. I wanna know, won't you tell me, I love to stay. Take me to the river, wash me down, won't you cleanse my soul, put my feet on the ground. I don't know why she treated me so bad, after all the things that we could have had. Love is an ocean that I can't forget, my sweet sixteen I will never regret. I wanna know, won't you tell me, I love to stay. I wanna know, won't you tell me, I love to stay. Take me to the river, wash me down, won't you cleanse my soul, put my feet on the ground. Love me, please me, tease me, till I change, till I change, till I change. Oh Lord! Take me to the river. I don't know why, out of your attitude, after all the things that you put me through, the sixteen candles that burn on my wall, tell me the babies are full of them all. I wanna know, won't you tell me, I love to stay. I wanna know, take me to the river. I wanna know, won't you dip me in the water. I wanna know, won't you walk me in the water. Walk me in the water. Walk me in the water. Won't you walk me in the water. Walk me in the water. Walk me in the water. Walk me in the water. Thank you.
