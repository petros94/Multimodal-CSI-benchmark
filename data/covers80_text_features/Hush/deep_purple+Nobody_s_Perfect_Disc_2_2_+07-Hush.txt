 All right. I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind. No doubt about it, she looks so fine. The best girl I've ever had. She's gonna make me feel so bad. Yeah, make me feel so bad. She's got love like quicksand, on the tip of a touch of my hand. Blowing my mind and I'm so deep. Can't hear it, oh I can't sleep. Oh I can't sleep. Na na na na na na na na na na. Hush, hush, I thought I heard a call to my name now. Hush, she took my heart but I love her just the same now. Hush, oh I thought I heard a call to my name now. Hush, hush, I need her loving but I'm not to blame now. Got a honey in the morning, a maid in the evening. Hush, I thought I heard a call to my name now. Hush, she took my heart but I love her just the same now. Hush, oh I thought I heard a call to my name now. Hush, hush, I need her loving but I'm not to blame now. Got a honey in the morning, a maid in the evening. Na na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na na. Thanks for watching!
