 Like a mud to a flame I'll pull you in, I'll pull you back to What you need initially It's just one go away And you leave him, you're loyal to me But this time I'll let you be Cause he seems like he's good for you And he makes you feel like you should And all your friends say he's the one His love for you is true But does he know you call me When he sleeps Or does he know the bad truths that you keep Or does he know the reasons that you cry Or tell me does he know what your heart loves Cause he seems like he's good for you And he makes you feel like you should And all your friends say he's the one His love for you is true But does he know you call me When he sleeps Or does he know the bad truths that you keep Or does he know the reasons that you cry Or tell me does he know what your heart loves Where it truly lies Thanks.
