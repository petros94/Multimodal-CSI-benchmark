 Come closer and see, see into the dreams, find the girl. If you can, come closer and see, see into the dark, just follow your eyes, just follow your eyes. I hear a voice calling my name, the song is deep in the dark. I hear a voice and start to run into the trees, into the trees. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards the end of the road. I'm sad I'm messed up, but I know it's too late. I'm lost to the forest, all alone. The goal was never there, it's always the same, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing. I'm running towards the end of the road, I'm running towards nothing.
