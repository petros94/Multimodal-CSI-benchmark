 I'm a walking culture song Hey guys, it's Erin Dewbough again Back to the Living Group Sessions This is one of my all-time favorite songs This is our take on Summer Breach Band So, hope you enjoy it Billy Ray was the preacher's son When his daddy with his, he'd come along When they gather round inside and talking That's when Billy would take me walking I'd do the back job, we'd go walking When I look into my eyes Lord knows some eyes arise The only one who could ever reach me Was the son of a preacher man The only boy who could ever teach me Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was, he was Oh, yes, he was Being good isn't always easy No matter how hard I try When it started sweet talking to me Come and tell me everything is alright Kiss and tell me everything is alright Can I get away and can I not? The only one who could ever reach me Was the son of a preacher man The only boy who could ever teach me Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was, he was Oh, yes, he was How will I remember The love was in his eyes Stealing kisses from me on the side Taking back what ain't mine Telling me that he's all mine Learning from each other's knowing Looking to see how much we grown And the only one who could ever reach me Was the son of a preacher man The only boy who could ever teach me Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was, he was Oh, yes, he was Oh, yes, he was Oh, yes, he was Oh, yes, he was Oh, yes, he was you you
