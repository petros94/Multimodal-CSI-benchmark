 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Rising up back on the street. Did my time, took my chances. With the distance now I'm back on my feet. Just a man and his will to survive. So many times it happens too fast. You trade your passion for glory. Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past. You must fight just to keep them alive. It's deep, high up in tiger. It's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of our rival. After the last known survivor strikes his bread in the night. And his worth to know is the eye of the tiger. Music playing. Face to face, out in the heat. Hanging into, staying hungry. Face back the odds, till we take to the street. For the guilt, with the skills to survive. It's deep, high up in tiger. It's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of our rival. After the last known survivor strikes his bread in the night. And his worth to know is the eye of the tiger. Music playing. Rising up straight to the top. And the guts got the glory. With the distance now I'm not gonna stop. Just a man, and his will to survive. It's deep, high up in tiger. It's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of our rival. And the last known survivor strikes his bread in the night. And his worth to know is the eye of the tiger. Music playing. The eye of the tiger. The eye of the tiger. The eye of the tiger. The eye of the tiger. Music playing.
