 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. I fall in in love, I fall in in love for the first time, this time I know it's for real, I fall in in love. God knows, God knows I'm falling in love, it's strange but it's true, yeah I can't get over when you're laughing like I do, but I have to be sure and I won't cut the doubt, oh I want to be free, baby. Oh I want to be free, oh I want to break free. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. But life still goes on, I can't get used to living without living without living without you by my side. I don't want to live alone, hey God knows, God don't make it on my own, so baby can't you see, I've got to break free. I've got to break free, I want to break free. I want, I want, I want, I want to break free. I want to break free.
