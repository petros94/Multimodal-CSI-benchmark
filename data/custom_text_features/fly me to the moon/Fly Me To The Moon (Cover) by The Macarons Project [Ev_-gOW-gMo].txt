 You You Find me to the moon and let me play among the stars Let me see where spring is like on Jupiter and Mars In other words, hold my hand In other words, darling kiss me Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore You were all I longed for, all I wished, it bent a door In other words, please be true In other words, I love you You You You You Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore You were all I longed for, all I wished, it bent a door In other words, please be true In other words, I love you In other words, I love you You
