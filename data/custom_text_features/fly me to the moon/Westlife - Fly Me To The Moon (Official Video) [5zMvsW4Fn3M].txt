 Fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like on, as Jupiter and Mars In other words, hold my hand In other words, baby, kiss me Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore You are all I long for, all I worship and adore In other words, please be true In other words, I love you You are all I long for, all I worship and adore In other words, please be true In other words, please be true Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore You are all I long for, all I worship and adore In other words, please be true In other words, in other words, I love you
