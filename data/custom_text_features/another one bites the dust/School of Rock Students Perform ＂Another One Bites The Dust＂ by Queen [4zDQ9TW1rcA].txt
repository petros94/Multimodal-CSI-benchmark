 BAM! BAM! Let's go! We've walked freely down the street with the boom-poo right on low We know sound with the sound of his feet Machine guns ready to go Are you ready? Hey! Are you ready for this? Are you hanging on the edge of your seat? Out of the door, at the bullets rip To the sound of the G.A. Another one bites the dust Another one bites the dust And another one, gone and another one, gone And another one bites the dust I want to get you to another one bites the dust How do you think I'm gonna get along without you and your gun? You took me for everything that I had and kicked me all my own Are you happy? Are you satisfied? How long can you stand the heat? Out of the door, at the bullet rip To the sound of the G.A. Listen! Another one bites the dust Another one bites the dust And another one, gone and another one, gone And another one bites the dust Hey! I'm gonna get you to another one bites the dust Another one bites the dust You're bad the dust, yeah Hey! Another one bites the dust Another one bites the dust Hey! Another one bites the dust Another one bites the dust Mmm, shoot There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man and bring him to the ground You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad and leave him when he's down, yeah But I'm ready, just to write him for you I'm standing on my own to feed Out of the door, at the bullet rip To the sound of the G.A. Another one bites the dust Another one bites the dust And another one, gone and another one, gone And another one bites the dust Hey! I'm gonna get you to another one bites the dust Shura Hey! Hey!
