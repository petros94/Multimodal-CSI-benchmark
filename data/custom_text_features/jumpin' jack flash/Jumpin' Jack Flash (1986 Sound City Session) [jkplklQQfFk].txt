 I will fall in the crossfire again. I will fall in the crossfire again. I would hold the night in the pouring rain. But it's alright now, it's back into gas. Set it right, set the trooper in place. It's a gas dance dance. Oh yeah, now, now, now, now, now, now, now. I was raised by a toothless, bent-in head. I was down with a strap right from my back. But it's alright now, it's back into gas. Set it right, to the death, back into gas. Oh yeah, now, now, now, now, now, now. Oh yeah, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now. My life was drowned, it was one dumb little day. I looked round and no one got out my friends. I looked down and my feet are golden red. And it was drowned with a spike right through his brain. But it's alright now, it's back into gas. Set it right, set the trooper in place. Set it right, set the trooper in place. Set it right, set the trooper in place. Don't be dead fast, it's a gas. Don't be dead fast, you know it's a gas. Don't be dead, don't be dead. I need a job again. Come on, I'll bring it back. Don't be dead. That one's for your mama. Don't be dead fast, it's a gas. Don't be dead fast, it's a gas. Don't be dead fast, it's a gas.
