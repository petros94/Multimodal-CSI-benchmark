 Music playing... See the stone set in your eyes, see the phone twist in your side. I'll wait for you. Slide of hand and twist of faith on a bed of nails, she makes me wait. And I wait without you, with or without you, with or without you. Through the storm we reach the shore, you give it all but I want more. And I'm waiting for you, with or without you, with or without you. I can't live, with or without you. Music playing... My hands are tied, my body bruised, she got me with, nothing to win. And nothing left to lose, and you give yourself away. And you give yourself away, and you give, and you give, and you give yourself away. With or without you, with or without you, I can't live, with or without you. Music playing... With or without you, with or without you, I can't live, with or without you, with or without you. Music playing... Music playing... Music playing... Music playing...
