 See the stone set in your eyes See the thorn twist in your sight And I wait for you Slay off harm then twist or fade On a bed of nails she makes me wait And I wait without you With or without you, with or without you Through the storm we reach the shore You give it all but I want more And I wait for you And you give yourself away With or without you, with or without you I can't live with or without you Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh My hands are tied, my body bruised She got me with nothing to wear And nothing left to lose And you give yourself away With or without you, with or without you I can't live with or without you Oh, can we live without you? Oh, can we live without you? Oh, can we live without you?
