 See the snow in the set in your eyes See the thorns twist in your sight And I'll wait for you This light of hand and twist of fate On a bed of nails she makes me wait And I'll wait without you With or without you, with or without you Through the storm we reach the shore You give it all but I want more And I'm waiting for you With or without you, with or without you I can't live with or without you And you give yourself away My hands are tied My body bruised You scour me with nothing to win And nothing left to lose And you give yourself away And you give yourself away With or without you, with or without you I can't live with or without you Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh With or without you, with or without you I can't live with or without you I can't live with or without you I can't live with or without you you you
