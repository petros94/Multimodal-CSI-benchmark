 I could escape this feeling with my child girl I feel the wreck without my little child of grud I hear her heart beating loud as thunder Slowly stars crashing I'm not messed without my little child of grud Wake up in the morning with my little child of grud I hear her heart beating loud as thunder Slowly stars crashing down I feel tragic like I'm more than a brimstone When I look at my child girl I could pretend I really meant too much When I look at my child girl Music I stumble into town just like a sacred cow Versions of swastikas in my head, plans for everyone It's in the way of my eyes My little child girl, you should look nice with me I'll ruin everything you are You know I'll give you television I'll give you eyes of blue I'll give you a man of hearts to rule the world I wouldn't get excited My little child girl says Oh baby, just you shut your mouth She says She says She says She says She says She says She says Oh, little child girl Oh, little child girl Thank you for watching!
