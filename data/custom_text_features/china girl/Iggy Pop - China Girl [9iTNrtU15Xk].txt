 I feel the state is through and different, I don't know I'm just a wacko, I'm not gonna tell ya I'm real happy and loud as thunder Solid stars crashing I'm undressed without much energy Look at me, there's much energy I'm real high speed and loud as thunder Solid stars crashing I feel tragic like I was blind and low And I'll get much higher again I keep pretending nothing will limit too much And I'll get much higher again Solid stars crashing I had storm water in the town, just like a sacred cow Visions of swastika in my head and fans forever at once It's in the wind My little chunger, you shouldn't mess with me I'll ruin everything you are I'll give you a tell-up engine, I'll give you eyes of love I'll give you a man who wanna roll the world I'll get excited, my little chunger says She will check to the subject of mine She says shh Shhh Solid stars crashing I'm undressed without much energy Solid stars crashing I'm undressed Solid stars crashing I'm undressed Solid stars crashing Solid stars crashing I'm undressed Solid stars crashing I'm undressed Solid stars crashing
