 Thank you. Thank you. A tenement, a dead man. A dirty street, walk to walk by shillers feet inside its lawn. So complete, watch by a shivering sun. Old eyes, the small child's face, watching as the shadows race through walls and cracks. Leave no trace, daylight's a prideless show. The day is a pearly spencer, our sun. The race is almost run. Nose pressed hard on frosty glass, gazing as the swollen mass. Unconquered fields where grows no grass, stumbles blindly on. Iron trees, smothered the air with a wrink, they stand and stare through eyes, but neither know nor care where the rest has gone. The day is a pearly spencer, our sun. The race is almost run. Pearly wears your milk white skin, what's that scubble on your chin? It's buried in the rock and chin, you play the last and hard one. You play the house, the campy beat now, look your heads bowed and defeat. You walk too far along the streets, it's where only rats can grow. The day is a pearly spencer, our sun. The race is almost run. The day is a pearly spencer, our sun. The race is almost run. The race is almost run. The race is almost run. A tenement, a dirty streak, remember one and shillers feet, remember how you stood to be the way your life had gone. So pearly don't you shed more tears for those best forgotten years, those tenements our memories of where you've risen from. The day is a pearly spencer, our sun. The race is almost run. The day is a pearly spencer, our sun.
