 A tenement, a dirty street Walked and worn by shoeless feet In silence long and so complete Watched by a shivering sun Old eyes in a small child's face Watching as the shadows raise Through walls and cracks And leave no trace And daylight's brightness shone The days of curly spinners Ah, the race is almost run Noist pressed hard and frosted glass Gazing as the swollen mass On concrete fields where grows no grass Stumbles blindly on Iron trees smother the air But with a ring they stand and stare Through eyes that neither know nor care Where the grass is gone The days of curly spinners Ah, the race is almost run The race is almost run Curly wears your milk white skin What's that stubble on your chin Buried in the rotgut gin You played and lost not one You played a house that can't be beat Now look your heads bowed in defeat You walk too far along the street Where only rats can run The days of curly spinners Ah, the race is almost run The days of curly spinners Ah, the race is almost run you Thank you.
