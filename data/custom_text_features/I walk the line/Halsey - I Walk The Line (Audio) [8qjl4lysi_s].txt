 I keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time I keep the end out for the time that binds Because you're mine, I walk the line I find it very, very easy to be true I find myself alone when each day is through Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you Because you're mine, I walk the line You've got a way to keep me on yourself You give me Christ for another time I can hide For you I know I'll even try to stop the time Because you're mine, I walk the line I walk the line Because you're mine, I walk the line I walk the line
