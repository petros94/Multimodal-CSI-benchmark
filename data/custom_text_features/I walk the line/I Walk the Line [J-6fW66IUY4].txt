 I keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time I keep the ends out for the pie that binds Because you're mine, I won't rely I find it very, very easy to be true I find myself alone when he stays through Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you Because you're mine, I walk the line As sure as night is dark and day is light I keep you on my mind both day and night And happiness I have no improves that it's right Because you're mine, I walk the line You've got a way to keep me on your side You give me calls for love that I can't hide For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide Because you're mine, I walk the line I keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time I keep the ends out for the pie that binds Because you're mine, I walk the line I keep the ends out for the pie that binds Because you're mine, I walk the line you Thank you.
