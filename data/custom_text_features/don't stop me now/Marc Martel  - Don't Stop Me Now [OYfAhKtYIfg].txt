 Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time I feel alive And the world I've turned it inside out I'm floating around in ecstasy So don't stop me now Don't stop me Cause I'm having a good time Having a good time I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky Like a jagger, jib-bye in the laws of gravity I'm a racing car passing by Like Lady Good-Dive-Ore I'm gonna go, go, go There's no stopping me I'm burning through the sky, yeah 200 degrees, that's why the cabin is too barren high I'm traveling at the speed of light I wanna make a supersonic man out of you Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time I'm having a ball Don't stop me now If you wanna have a good time Just give me a call Don't stop me now Cause I'm having a good time Having a good time Yes, I'm having a good time I don't wanna stop at all Woo! I'm a rocket ship on my way to war So no collision cause I'm a satellite I'm out of control I'm a set machine ready to reload Like an atom bomb About to roar We'll explode I'm burning through the sky, yeah 200 degrees, that's why the cabin is too barren high I'm traveling at the speed of light I wanna make a supersonic woman out of you Don't stop me Hey, hey, hey I like it Have a good time, good time Don't stop me now Oh! Oh! I'm burning through the sky, yeah 200 degrees, that's why the cabin is too barren high I'm traveling at the speed of light I wanna make a supersonic man out of you Don't stop me now I've been having such a good time I'm having a fall Don't stop me now If you wanna have a good time Just give me a call Don't stop me now Cause I'm having a good time Yes, I'm having a good time I don't wanna stop at all La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo.
