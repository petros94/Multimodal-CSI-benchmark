 A little bit more time. Come on. You can have it right now. Family thing, yeah. You. You. You. You're my husband. Okay? That's it. No more. That was right. I can't see... only fools rushing. And I ain't... falling in love with you. My husband's saying... only fools rushing. And I ain't... falling in love with you. Shall I stay? Would it be easier to see? I can't live... falling in love with you. As the river flow... gently to the sea... and I live so we go... something we're meant to be. Take my hand... take my whole life to you. I can't live... falling in love with you. As the river flow... gently to the sea... and I live so we go... something we're meant to be. Take my hand... take my whole life to you. I can't live... falling in love with you. I can't live... falling in love with you. I can't live... falling in love with you. I can't live... falling in love with you. You're making me do something I don't want to do. I'm ready. Are you ready? I'm ready. You. You.
