 Music playing. Wise men say only fools ration. But I can't help falling in love with you. Shall I stay? Would it be a sin? If I can't help falling in love with you. Make a river flows surely to the sea. Darling so it goes some things are meant to be. Take my hand, take my whole life too. For I can't help falling in love with you. Make a river flows surely to the sea. Darling so it goes some things are meant to be. So take my hand, take my whole life too. For I can't help falling in love with you. No I can't help falling in love with you. Music playing. Music playing.
