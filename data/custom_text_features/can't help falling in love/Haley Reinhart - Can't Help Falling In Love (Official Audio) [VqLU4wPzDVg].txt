Oh, if I can't help Falling in love with you Oh, like a river flows Surely to the sea Darling, so we go Some things are meant to be Take my hand Take my whole life too Oh, for I can't help Falling in love with you Oh, like a river flows Surely to the sea Darling, so we go Some things are meant to be Take my hand Take my whole life too For I can't help Falling in love with you Oh, for I can't help Falling in love with you You you Thank you.
