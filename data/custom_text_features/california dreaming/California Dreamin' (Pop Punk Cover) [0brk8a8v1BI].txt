 All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray I've been for a walk on the winter's day I'd be safe and warm if I was in LA California, California, dreaming of such a winter's day Stuck into a church, I passed a long way Where I got down on my knee, and I pretend to pray You know the preacher likes to code, he knows I'm gonna stay California, California, dreaming of such a winter's day All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray I've been for a walk on the winter's day All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray I've been for a walk on the winter's day If I didn't ever, I could leave today California, California, dreaming of such a winter's day California, dreaming of such a winter's day California, dreaming of such a winter's day All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray
