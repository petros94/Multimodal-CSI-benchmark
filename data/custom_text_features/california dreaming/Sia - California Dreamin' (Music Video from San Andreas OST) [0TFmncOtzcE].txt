 All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey I've been for walk on winter's day I'd be safe from war if I was an island California dreaming of you, you said to win or die All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey I've been for walk on a winter's day I'd be safe from war if I was an island California dreaming of you, you said to win or die I stopped into a cage, I passed it on the way I got down with my knees and I went to another grave You never bring your life before, you know that I'm gonna stay California dreaming of you, you said to win or die I'd be safe from war, I'd be safe from war I'd be safe from war, I'd be safe from war I'd be safe from war, I'd be safe from war All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey I've been for a walk on winter's day If I didn't know that I could live today California dreaming of you, you said to win or die I've been for a walk on winter's day I've been for a walk on winter's day
