 All the leaves are now alone And the sky is gray I'd be your lover All the windows say I'd be straight in the house If I was a lady Can't find a dream in my mind From such a way to stay Stopping through church I pass along the way Well, I've got the one mind And I pretend to pray I pretend to pray In other creatures I may call Because I'm gonna stay Can't find a dream in my mind From such a way to stay Can't find a dream in my mind From such a way to stay Can't find a dream in my mind From such a way to stay Can't find a dream in my mind From such a way to stay All the leaves are now alone And the sky is gray I'd be your lover All the windows say If I didn't tell her I would leave the way Now I'm on your dream Of such a way to stay Of such a way to stay Of such a way to stay ... ... you Thank you.
