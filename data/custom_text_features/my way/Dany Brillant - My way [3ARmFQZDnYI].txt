 And now the end is near And so I face the final curtain My friend, I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain I've lived a lie that's thought I've traveled each and every highway And more, much more than this I did it my way I regret a lot of you, but then again too few to mention I've heard it, what I had to do And so it proved without exemption I've planned each other's course, each careful step along the highway And more, much more than this I did it my way Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew When I bet on more than I could choose But true it all, when there was doubt I had to do and spit it out I fasted on and asked to do and did it more I've laughed, I've laughed and cried I've had my fill, my share of losing And now I'm still so sad My funny toes so amusing To think I did all that and may I say, not in a shy way Oh no, oh no, not me I did it my way What is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has not To say the things he truly feels And now the words of one who needs The record shows I took the blows And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way
