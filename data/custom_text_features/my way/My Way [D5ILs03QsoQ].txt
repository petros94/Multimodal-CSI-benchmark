 And now the end is near, so I face the final curtain. I've found, I'll say it true, I'll state my case of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's full, I've traveled each and every highway and more. Much more than this I did admire, and regrets I've had a few, but then again, to a few to mention, I did what I had to do and saw it through without exception. I've planned each charted course, each careful step along the highway and more. Much more than this I did admire. Yes, there were times I'm sure of you, that I'd be lost more than I could chew, but through it all, and there was doubt, I ate it all, and spit it out. I ain't faced it all, and I asked to talk, and when did it my way? I've loved, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill, my share of food. And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing. The thing I did all that, and may I say, not in a shy way, oh no, oh no, I did it my way. Oh what is a man, what has he got? He's not himself, and he has not. To say the words, he truly fears, and not the words. One year, the record shows, I took the blows, and did it my way. Ah, ah, ah. you
