 The End And now the end is near And so I face the final curtain You can't, I'm not the queer I'll state my case of which I'm certain I've lived a life that's full of each And every highway exits Much more than this, I did it my way Regrets, I've had a few But then again, took it a mention I did what I had to do I saw it prove, work doesn't mean no sin Or plans, I can't uncut They can't push up or run the office And more, much more than this, I did it my way And what times, I'm sure you knew When there was fucking, fuck, fuck, girl else to do But do it now, when there was that I shuck it up or get it down I faced the wall and the wall And did it my way I loved, and been as nice I've had my fill, I shit a blue thing And now, the tears have dried I'm running out, so amazing To think, I killed a cat And my eyes sigh, not in the sky I'm not, I'm not on my, I did it my way For what is a great task? What has he got, when he wears hats And he cannot, so the things, ain't true they failed But only the words, of what it means The record shows, I shuck a blow And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way And did it my way you you
