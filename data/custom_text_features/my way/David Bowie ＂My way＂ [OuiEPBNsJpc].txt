 And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's full, I've traveled each and every highway, and more, much more than this, I didn't mind. But that's, I've had a few, but then again, just few to mention. I did all I had to do, and saw it through, without exemption. I've planned each child it calls, each careful step along the highway, and more, much more than this, I didn't mind. There's several times I'm sure you knew, when I've been up, old like a child, but through it all, when there was doubt, I hated it, and spit it out. I've faced it all, and I stood tall, and did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill, my share of losing. Now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing, to think I did all that, and may I say, not in a shy way, Oh no, a moon like me, I did not. For what else a man, what has he got, if not himself, there he has not to say the things, and it truly feels, and not the words of what it means, to bring it's own. I took the most, and did it my way. Yes, it was my way. Thank you for watching.
