 Come on! Get your motor running Head out on the highway Looking for a future Then whatever comes our way Yeah, driving on to make it happen Change the world in the loving grace Fire all of the guns that want it Exploding space I like smoking lightning Heavy metal thunder Racing with the wind And the feeling that I'm under Yeah, driving on to make it happen Change the world in the loving grace Fire all of the guns that want it Exploding space Like a true nature charm We were born to be wild Waking clouds away Never one time Born to be wild Born to be wild Waking clouds away Waking clouds away Get your motor running Head out on the highway Looking for a future Then whatever comes our way Yeah, driving on to make it happen Change the world in the loving grace Fire all of the guns that want it Exploding space Like a true nature charm We were born to be wild Waking clouds away Never one time Born to be wild Born to be wild Watch out for a drive Born to be wild Born to be wild Born to be wild Born to be wild Born to be wild Born to be wild Born to be wild
