 Music Get your motor running Head out on the highway Looking for adventure And whatever comes our way Yeah darling go make it happen Take the world in a loving place By all of the guns and guns Exploded to space Highlight smoking lightning Heavy metal thunder Arresting with the wind And the feeling that I'm under Yeah darling go make it happen Take the world in a loving place By all of the guns and guns Exploded to space Like a true nature's child We were born, born to be wild We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wild Music Music Get your motor running Head out on the highway Looking for adventure And whatever comes our way Yeah darling go make it happen Take the world in a loving place By all of the guns and guns Exploded to space Like a true nature's child We were born, born to be wild We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wild Music you Thank you.
