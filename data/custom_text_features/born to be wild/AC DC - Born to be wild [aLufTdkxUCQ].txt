 The End. The End. The End. I got a girl I'm making half-pied Take the world in a loving embrace Fire all your guns at once and Expand into space I broke a lightning Heavy metal thunder Race with the breeze And I feel another man there Yeah, God, I'm gonna make it half-pied Take the world in a loving embrace Fire all your guns at once and Expand into space After two years of time We were born all up in wine We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wild After two years of time I'm gonna run you And I'm on the highway Looking for a filter In whatever comes around I got a girl I'm making half-pied Take the world in a loving embrace Fire all your guns at once and Expand into space After two years of time We were born all up in wine We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wild Born to be wild Born to be wild I said, go Gonna be wild I said, go Gonna be wild Gonna be wild I said, go Thank you.
