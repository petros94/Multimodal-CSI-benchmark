 Baby, baby, baby don't leave me, oh please don't leave me, all by myself I've got this burning, burning, yearning, feeling inside me, deep inside me And it hurts so bad, you came into my heart, so tell her leave, with a burning love, that's things like a beat Now that I've surrendered, so help me, and I wanna leave, oh you wanna leave me, oh baby baby baby Where did our love go? Oh don't you want me? Don't you want me no more? Oh baby baby Baby, baby, where did our love go? And all your promises, all the love I ever mowed I've got this burning, burning, yearning, feeling inside me, deep inside me And it hurts so bad, before you were not, you were a perfect guy But now that you got me, you wanna leave me behind, oh baby baby baby Baby don't leave me, oh please don't leave me, all by myself Baby, baby, where did our love go? Oh don't you want me? Don't you want me no more? Oh baby baby Baby, baby, where did our love go?
