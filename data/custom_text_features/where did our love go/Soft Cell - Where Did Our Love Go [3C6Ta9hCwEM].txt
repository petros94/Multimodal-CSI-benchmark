Oh, don't you leave me, don't you leave me no more I've got this burning, yearning, yearning feeling inside me Oh, deep inside me, I hurt so bad You came into my life, so tenderly with the burning love That stings like a bee, and I run somewhere So helplessly, you know I believe You wanna leave me, oh baby baby Where did our love go? Oh, don't you leave me, don't you leave me no more Oh, baby baby, where did our love go? Oh, don't you leave me, don't you leave me no more You came into my life, so tenderly with the burning love That stings like a bee, and I run somewhere So helplessly, you know I believe That you wanna leave me, oh baby baby Running and running, oh baby baby Don't you leave me, oh, I've got this burning, yearning feeling inside me Oh, deep inside me, I hurt so bad Baby baby baby Where did our love go? Oh, don't you leave me, don't you leave me no more I know that I'm surrounded So helplessly, you know I believe You wanna leave me, oh baby baby Where did our love go? Where did our love go? Where, where, where now I'm surrounded So helplessly, you know I believe That you wanna leave me, baby Where did our love go? Where did our love go? Where, where, where baby baby Where did our love go? Oh, don't you leave me, don't you leave me I've got this burning, burning, yearning feeling inside me Oh, deep inside me, and it hurts so bad Baby baby baby Baby baby baby Baby baby baby
