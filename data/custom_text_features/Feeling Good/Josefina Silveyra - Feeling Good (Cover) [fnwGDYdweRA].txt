 The world is a new day, a new life, a new life. For me, and I'm feeling good. I'm a new day, a new life, a new life. It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life. For me, and I'm feeling good. Dragonfly, how in the sun and you know what I mean. When day's done, that's what I mean. And this whole world, it's a new world and a bold world. For me, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's times when you shine and you know how I feel. The scent of the pine and you know how I feel. Oh, freedom is mine and you know how I feel. It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life. For me, for me. And I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling so good. Hit the road, Jack, don't you come back, no more, no more. you you
