 I'm going to sing a song for you. It's a new dawn, it's a new day. It's a new life for me, yeah. It's a new dawn, it's a new day. It's a new life for me, yeah. It's a new dawn, it's a new day. It's a new dawn, it's a new day. It's a new dawn, it's a new day. It's a new life for me, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. And I'm feeling good. Fish in the sea, you know how I feel. River running free, you know how I feel. Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel. It's a new dawn, it's a new day. It's a new life for me, yeah. And I'm feeling good. Dragon fly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know? Butterflies all having fun, you know what I mean. Sleeping peace when day is done, that's what I mean. And this old world is a new world, and a bold world for me. Yeah, yeah. Stars when you shine, you know how I feel. Sand all the pine, you know how I feel. Freedom is mine, and I know how I feel. It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me. And I'm feeling good. Oh. Thank you.
