 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. I've been waiting for a guy to come and take me by the hand Could these sensations make me feel the pleasure of a normal man? These sensations barely interest me for another day I've got the spirit loose the feeling, take this shock away I've got the spirit loose the feeling, take this shock away I've got the spirit loose the feeling, take this shock away I've got the spirit loose the feeling, take this shock away I've got the spirit loose the feeling, take this shock away I've got the spirit loose the feeling, take this shock away On the tenfold down the back stairs, it's a no-bans land Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now I've got the spirit loose the feeling, let it out somehow I've got the spirit loose the feeling, let it out somehow I've got the spirit loose the feeling, let it out somehow I've got the spirit loose the feeling, let it out somehow I've got the spirit loose the feeling, let it out somehow I'm gonna see you, I'm gonna see me, and we will meet again I'm watching you, I'm watching her, take the beat from your friends Who is right, who can tell, who gives a damn right now Until the spirit loose sensation takes hold then you know Until the spirit loose sensation takes hold then you know Until the spirit loose sensation takes hold then you know I've got the spirit loose the feeling, I've got the spirit loose the feeling I've got the spirit loose the feeling, I've got the spirit loose the feeling I loose the feeling, I loose the feeling, I've got the spirit But I loose the feeling, I loose the feeling I loose the feeling Thank you.
