 Music playing I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand Coat these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man These sensations bear the answers we've been for another day I've got this very lucid feeling, take the shuffle away Music playing Music playing It's getting faster moving faster now, it's getting out of hand On the tenfold, on the back stairs, into no man's lap Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now I've got this very lucid feeling, let it out somehow Music playing Music playing What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again I'm watching you, I watch it all, I take no pity from your friends Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now Until the spirit in your sensation takes hold, then you know Until the spirit in your sensation takes hold, then you know Until the spirit in your sensation takes hold, then you know I've got this very lucid feeling, let it out somehow I've got this very lucid feeling, let it out somehow Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling Music playing you
