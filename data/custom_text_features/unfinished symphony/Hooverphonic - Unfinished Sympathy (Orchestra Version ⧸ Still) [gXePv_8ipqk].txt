 I know that I've been mad in love before And how it could be with you Really hurt me babe, really cut me babe How can you help the day without an eye You're the book that I've opened And now I got to know much more It's cure your snus if your potential keys It's got my mind and body again Really hurt me babe, really cut me babe How can you help the day without an eye You're the book that I've opened And now I got to know much more Like a soul without a mind In a body without art I'm missing every part Like a soul without a mind In a body without art I'm missing every part Like a soul without art
