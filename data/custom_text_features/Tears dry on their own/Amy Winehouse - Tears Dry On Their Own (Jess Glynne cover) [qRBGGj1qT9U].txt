 My next show! All I can ever feed you is the darkness that we know And there's your great I got accustomed to Once it was alright when we were at our high Waiting for you in a hotel at night I knew I had to remember my match But every moment we could snatch I don't know why I got so attached It's my responsibility And you don't know nothing of me But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm gone And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own I don't understand why do I stress a man When there's so many bigger things at hand We could've never had it all So we had to hit a wall And this was an ever to far withdrawal Even if I start wanting you A perspective pushes through I'll be some next man's other world by soon I shouldn't blame myself again I should just be my own best friend I mess myself in the head with stupid men Oh, he walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm gone And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own So we are history And your shadow covers me The sky above the place He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm gone And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own I wish I could say no regrets No emotion, no debts Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets So we are history And your shadow covers me The sky above the place Only love will see oh He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, and I am grown And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own He walks away, the sun goes down And I am grown, but in your way In this deep shade My tears dry on their own Transcribed by ESO, translated by â€” Thank you.
