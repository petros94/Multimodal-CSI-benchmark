 All I can't ever be to you is the darkness that we knew And this regret I got accustomed to Once it was alright, we were at our height Waiting for you in the hotel at night I knew I hadn't met my match But every moment we could snatch I don't know why I got so attached It's my responsibility You don't owe nothing to me But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away The sun goes down He takes the day but I'm grown And any other way In this blue shade My heart is dry on their own I don't understand What do I stress the man There's so many bigger things ahead We could have never had it all We had to hit a wall So this isn't if it's a pull we draw Even if I stop wanting you And perspective pushes through I'll be some next man to the woman soon Can I play myself again? Should just be my own best friend I fuck myself in the head with stupid men He walks away The sun goes down He takes the day but I'm grown And any other way In this blue shade My heart is dry on their own Yeah, so be our history Your shadow covers me The sky above a blaze Oh, he walks away The sun goes down He takes the day but I'm grown And any other way In this blue shade My heart is dry on their own I wish I could sing no regrets No emotional death Cause this week is goodbye to the sun sets Oh, so be our history Your shadow covers me The sky above a blaze Oh, he walks away The sun goes down He takes the day but I'm grown And any other way In this blue shade My heart is dry on their own He walks away The sun goes down He takes the day but I'm grown And any other way In this blue shade My heart is dry on their own Dry on their own Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Thank you. Thank you.
