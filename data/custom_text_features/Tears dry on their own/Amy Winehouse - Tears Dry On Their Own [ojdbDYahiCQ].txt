 All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we know And this regret I got a crush on too Once you walked the ride, when we were at our hide Waiting for you in the hotel at night I knew I had them at my match, but every moment we get snatched I don't know why I got so attached It's my responsibility, you don't owe nothing to me But to walk away I have no progress or teeth He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm grown And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own I don't understand, why do I stress the man When there's so many real good things at hand We could have never had it all, we had to hit a wall So this is never to be withdrawn Even if I stop wanting you, that perspective pushes through I'll be some next man, it's all the warmer so Can I pray myself again? Should just be my own best friend I fuck myself in the head with Superman He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm grown And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own So we are history, the shadow of color The sky is above us, hey He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm grown And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own I wish I could say no regrets, and almost a no death Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets So we are history, the shadow covers me The sky above us, hey, it's an only love of sea He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm grown And in your way, in this blue shade My tears dry on their own He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I am grown And in your way, in this deep shade My tears dry on their own He walks away, the sun goes down He takes the day, but I'm grown And in your way, in this deep shade My tears dry I love you you Thank you.
