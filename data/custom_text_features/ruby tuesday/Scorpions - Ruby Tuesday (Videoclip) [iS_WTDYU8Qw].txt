 She would never say where she came from. Yesterday don't matter if it's gone. Why the sun is bright, or in the darkest night, no one knows. She comes and goes. Goodbye, rub it you safe, hope could hang a name on you. When you change with every new day, still I'm gonna miss you. Don't question why she needs to be so free. She tell you it's the only way to be. Cause she just can't be changed, until a life where nothing's gained and nothing's lost. Oh no, at such a cost. Goodbye, rub it you safe, hope could hang a name on you. When you change with every new day, still I'm gonna miss you. There's no time to lose, I heard her say. Catch your dreams before they slip away. I'm dying all the time, lose your dreams and you will lose your mind. Ain't life a kind. Goodbye, rub it you safe, hope could hang a name on you. When you change with every new day, still I'm gonna miss you. Goodbye, rub it you safe, hope could hang a name on you. When you change with every new day, still I'm gonna miss you. Still I'm gonna miss you. You.
