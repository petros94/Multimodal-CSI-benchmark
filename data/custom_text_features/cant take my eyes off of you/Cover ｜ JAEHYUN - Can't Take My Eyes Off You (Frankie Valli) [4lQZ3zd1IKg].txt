 You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You'd be like heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much And love less love has arrived And I think God I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you I love you baby And if it's quite alright I need you baby To one my lonely night I love you baby Trust in me when I say Oh pretty baby Don't let me down I'll pray Oh pretty baby Now that I found you stay And let me love you baby Let me love you Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The sight of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel like I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you I love you baby And if it's quite alright I need you baby To one my lonely night I love you baby Trust in me when I say Oh pretty baby Don't let me down I'll pray Oh pretty baby Now that I found you stay And let me love you baby Let me love you You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You'd be like heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much And long last love has arrived I think God I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you you
