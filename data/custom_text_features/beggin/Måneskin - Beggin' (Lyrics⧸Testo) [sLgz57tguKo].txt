 Put your loving hand out baby Cause I'm begging I'm begging, begging you to put your loving hand out baby I'm begging, begging you to put your loving hand out darling Riding high when I was king I played at the hard and fast side of everything I walked away, you want me dead But easy come and easy go and it wouldn't So anytime I bleed you let me go, yeah Anytime I feel you got me, no Anytime I see you let me know But the plan and see just let me go I'm all money when I'm begging Cause I don't wanna lose you Hey yeah Cause I'm begging, begging you Put your loving hand out baby I'm begging, begging you Put your loving hand out darling I need you to understand Try so hard to be your man The kind of man you want in the end Only then can I begin to live again An empty shell I used to be The shadow of my life was hanging over me A broken man that I don't know Won't even stand, I'd never stand To be my soul while we're chewing While we're chasing, why the bottom? Why the basement? Why we got good shit on embrace? Why the fields for the need to replace me? You're the wrong way, try to find the good I went up in the beach, you're telling why we could be at Like a heart in the best way, shit You can't give it away, you'll have and you take the pain But I keep walking on, keep moving the dust Keep walking far, let the dog eat yours Keep also home, cause I don't wanna live in a broken home Cause I'm begging Hey yeah I'm begging, begging you Stop with your love in the hand now baby I'm begging, begging you Stop with your love in the hand now darling I'm finding hard to hold my own Just can't make it all alone I'm holding on, I can't fall back I'm just a call, but to face the black I'm begging, begging you Put your loving hand out baby I'm begging, begging you Stop with your love in the hand now darling I'm begging, begging you Stop with your love in the hand now baby I'm begging, begging you Stop with your love in the hand now darling I'm begging, begging you Stop with your love in the hand now baby I'm begging, begging you Stop with your love in the hand now Thanks for watching! Thank you.
