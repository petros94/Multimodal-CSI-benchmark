 Put your loving hand out baby I'm begging. I'm begging. I'm begging. Put your loving hand out baby I'm begging. I'm begging you. Put your loving hand out baby. Ridein' high when I was kid, waited partin' fast cause I had everything. You walked away, you wanted them, but easy comin', easy goin' it wouldn't. I'm begging you. Won't you give your hand out baby? I'm begging. I'm begging. Put your loving hand out baby. I need you to understand that I tried so hard to be a man. The kind of man you wanted me in. Only then can I forget you even again. An empty shell used to be the shadow of my life just hangin' over me. Broken man, thought of lonely, believed in standard devil's chance to win my soul. I'm begging. I'm begging you. Won't you give your hand out baby? I'm begging. I'm begging you. Put your loving hand out baby. I'm fightin' hard to hold my own. No one just can't make it all alone. I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back. Now that deep grass, we need to shade a black. I'm begging you. Won't you give your hand out baby? I'm begging. I'm begging. Put your loving hand out baby. I'm begging you. you Thank you.
