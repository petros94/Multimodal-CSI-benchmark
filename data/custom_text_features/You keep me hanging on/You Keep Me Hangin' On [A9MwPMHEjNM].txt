 Music Set me free, why don't you baby? Get out my life, why don't you baby? But you don't really love me You just keep me hanging on You don't really need me But you keep me hanging on Why do you keep on coming around Playing with my heart? Why don't you get out of my life And let me make a new start? Let me get over you The way you've gotten over me Hey, set me free, why don't you baby? Let me be why don't you baby? Cause you don't really love me You just keep me hanging on Now you don't really want me You just keep me hanging on You say although we broke up You still wanna be just friends But how can you still be friends? When seeing you only breaks my heart again And there ain't nothing I can do about it Set me free, why don't you baby? Why don't you baby? Set me free, why don't you baby? Get out my life, why don't you baby? You claim you still care for me But your heart and soul needs to be free But now that you've got your freedom You wanna still hold on to me You don't want me for yourself So let me find somebody else Why don't you be a man about it? And set me free Now you don't care for anything about me You're just using me Go on, get out, get out of my life And let me sleep at night But you don't really love me You just keep me hanging on
