 Last time I was afraid, I was better by Can't thinkin' I could never live without you by my side But then I spent so many nights, thinkin' how you did me wrong And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along And so, you're back from outer space I just wanted to find you here with that said look for your face Shrimp changes to be locked, should've meant you leave me here By enough, just one second you'd be back to bother me Go on now, go, walk out of door Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with a fight You think I'd crumble, you think I'd lay down and die I will survive, for as long as I know how to love I know I'm still alive, I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give and I'll survive I will survive In too cold a strength I had not to fall apart Kept trying far too many pieces of my broken heart Nights went old so many nights, feeling sorry for myself I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high You see me, somebody do I'm not the changeable person still in love with you Now you've felt like wrapping in and they expect me to be free Now I'm saving all my lovin' so one who's loving me, go on now, go Walk out of door, just turn around now Cause you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with a fight You think I'd crumble, you think I'd lay down and die I will survive, for as long as I know how to love I know I'm still alive, I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give and I'll survive I will survive I will survive I will survive I will survive I will survive I will survive I will survive I will survive I will survive We're not done yet, we're going to do something crazy Open air!
