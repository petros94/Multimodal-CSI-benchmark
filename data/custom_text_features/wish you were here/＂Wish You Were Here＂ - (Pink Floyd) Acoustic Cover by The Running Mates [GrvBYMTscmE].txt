 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell Blue skies from pain Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell Did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change Handed you exchange Walk on part in the war They rolled in a cake. Music playing. How I wish, how I wish you were here Cause we're just two large soul swimming In a fishbowl year after year Running over the same old ground Have we found the same old fears I wish you were here. Music playing. Music playing. Thank you.
