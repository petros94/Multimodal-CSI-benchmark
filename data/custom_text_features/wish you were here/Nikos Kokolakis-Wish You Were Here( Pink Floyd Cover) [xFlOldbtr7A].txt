 you you you you you you you you Music Music Music So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell, blue skies from pain Can you tell a green field From a cold still around You smile from a veil Do you think you can tell Did they get you betrayed Your heroes were ghosts Hot-ass trees Hotter for good reasons Cold-cold for future Did you ever taste Your walk on pause in the war For lead growth indicates Music Music How I wish, how I wish you were here You were just too lost Soon you'd need a baseball Two years after you Running on the same old ground What have you found To say all this Wish you were here Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Thank you.
