 I was five and he was six We rode on horses made of sticks He wore black and I wore white He would always win the fight Bang bang, he shot me down, bang bang I hit the ground, bang bang That awful sound, bang bang My baby shot me down I knew the world, I knew the world, I knew the world Seasons came and changed the time When I grew up I caught in mine He would always laugh and say Remember when we used to play Bang bang, I shot you down, bang bang You hit the ground, bang bang That awful sound, bang bang I used to shoot you down Music played and people sang Checked for me the church bells rang Now he's gone, I don't know why Until this day I sometimes cry He didn't even say goodbye He didn't take the time to lie Bang bang, he shot me down, bang bang I hit the ground, bang bang That awful sound, bang bang My baby shot me down My baby shot me down My baby shot me down Shot me down Shot me down, down, down, down Thanks for watching!
