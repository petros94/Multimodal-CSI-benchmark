 I was five and he was six We rode on horses made of sticks He wore black and I wore white He would always win the fight, bang, bang He shot me down, bang, bang I hit the ground, bang, bang That awful sound, bang, bang My baby shot me down The seasons came and changed the time When I grew up I called him mine He would always laugh and say Remember when we used to play, bang, bang I shot you down, bang, bang You hit the ground, bang, bang That awful sound, bang, bang I used to shoot you down Music played and people sang Just for me the church bells rang Now he's gone, I don't know why Until this day sometimes I cry He didn't even say goodbye He didn't take the time to lie Bang, bang, he shot me down, bang, bang I hit the ground, bang, bang That awful sound, bang, bang My baby shot me down End of part one
