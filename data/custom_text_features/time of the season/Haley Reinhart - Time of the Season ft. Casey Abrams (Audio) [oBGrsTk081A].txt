 It's the time of a season When love runs high And this time, give it to me easy And let me try with pleasureed hands To take you in the sun to promise less To show you everyone It's the time of the season for loving What's your name? Who's your daddy? Is he rich like me? Has he taken any time? To show you what you need to live Tell it to me slowly Tell you what I really wanna know It's the time of the season for loving What's your name? Who's your daddy? Is he rich like me? Tell it to me slowly Tell you what I really wanna know It's the time of the season for loving What's your name? Who's your daddy? Is he rich like me? Has he taken any time? To show you what you need to live Tell it to me slowly Tell you what I really wanna know It's the time of the season for loving It's the time of the season for loving It's the time of the season for loving It's the time of the season for loving
