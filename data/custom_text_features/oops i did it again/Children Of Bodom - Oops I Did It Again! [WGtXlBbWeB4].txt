I didn't mind, seemed like a crush But it doesn't mean that I'm serious I've lost all my senses That is just so specific for me Oh baby, baby! I did it again I made you believe we're more than just friends I lost in the game, I made you believe I hope you think I'm your love There's different love for me I'm not dead in the past I made my problem, missed it I'm dreaming away Waking the heat of the 40s I cry watching the days Can I see I'm a fool in so many ways I've lost all my senses That is just so specific for me I did it again I made you believe we're more than just friends I hope you think I'm your love There's different love for me I'm not dead in the sand I'm not dead in the sand I'm not dead in the sand I'm not dead in the sand It's not that I'm not going to the gym anymore No, I'm going to the gym, I'll see what I can do for you You're looking good, I'm not a good guy I'm a six-pack, yes I'm not gonna be a six-pack, I'm gonna be a six-pack I'm not gonna be a six-pack, I'm gonna be a six-pack I'm not gonna be a six-pack, I'm not gonna be a six-pack I'm not dead in the sand I did it again in your heart Done long in the game of baby I hope you think that I'm dead from above I'm not dead in the sand I hope I did it again I'm good to go Got lots of energy I'm a big man, I hope you think I'm in love I'm dead in the sand I'm not dead in the sand I'm dead in the sand Woo!
