 Are you going to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, Remember me to one who lives there, She once was a true love of mine. Tell her to make me a candle-rich shirt, To the deep forest green. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, I want snow-crusted plow, Without no sleep, My gates and echoes the chaddle, And she'll be a true love of mine. I will ever cloud the undercar, Tell her to find me a saver of my spring-glee. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, I want snow-crusted plow, Between the salt water and the sea strands, And my lashes of fennel, She'll be a true love of mine. Tell her to re-bid in a sickle-mill of blazing, Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, I will pour her my sorbetters to keep, And gather it all, And a five-inch of embers, A roll of gold for that, She'll be a true love of mine. Are you going to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, Remember me to one who is there, She once was a true love of mine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
