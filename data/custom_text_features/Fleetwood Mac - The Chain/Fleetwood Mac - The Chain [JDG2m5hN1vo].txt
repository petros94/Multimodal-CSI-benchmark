 Thank you. Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise. Run in the shadows, down your love, down your life. And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you say it, you will never break the chain. You don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you say it, you will never break the chain. Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night. Run in the shadows, down your love, down your life. Break the silence, down the dark, down the light. And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you say it, you will never break the chain. You don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you say it, you will never break the chain. You don't love me now, you will never break the chain. You don't love me now, you will never break the chain. You don't love me now, you will never break the chain. Run in the shadows, run in the shadows. Run in the shadows, run in the shadows.
