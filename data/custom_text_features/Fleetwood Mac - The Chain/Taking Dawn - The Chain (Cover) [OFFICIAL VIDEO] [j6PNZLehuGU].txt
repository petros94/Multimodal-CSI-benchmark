 Thank you. Listen to the wind blow. Listen to the wind blow. Watch the sun rise. Run in the shadows. Damn your love, damn your lies. And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. Come to me. Listen to the wind blow. Walk down, comes the night. Run in the shadows. Damn your love, damn your lies. Break the silence. Damn your love, damn your lies. And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain. Chain keeps us together. Run in the shadows. Chain keeps us together. I'm running in the shadows. Chain keeps us together. Run in the shadows. Chain keeps us together. I'm running in the shadows. Chain keeps us together. Run in the shadows. Chain keeps us together. I'm running in the shadows. Chain keeps us together. Run in the shadows. Chain keeps us together. I'm running in the shadows. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
