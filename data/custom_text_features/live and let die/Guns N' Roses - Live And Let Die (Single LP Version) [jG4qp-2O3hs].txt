 You were young and your heart was an open book You used to say you'd live and let live You know you're touching, know you're touching, know you're taking it Thought it this ever-changing world in which we're living Makes you give in and cry You said you'd live and let die You'd live and let die You'd live and let die You'd live and let die What did it matter to you? When you got a job to do, you got to do it well You got to get the other part of it You used to say you'd live and let live You know you're touching, know you're touching, know you're taking it Thought it this ever-changing world in which we're living Makes you give in and cry You said you'd live and let die You'd live and let die You'd live and let die You'd live and let die
