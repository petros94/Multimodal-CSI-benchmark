 I'm the sun in the air All the shabiness that is criminally robber I'm the sun in the air Of nothing in particular You shut your mouth How can you see I go back in the wrong way I am a human that I need to be loved Just like everybody else does I'm the sun in the air All the shabiness that is criminally robber I'm the sun in the air Of nothing in particular You shut your mouth How can you see I go back in the wrong way I am a human that I need to be loved Just like everybody else does There's a club if you'd like to go You could make somebody who really loves you So you go and you stand on your own And you live on your own And you go home And you cry and you want to die When is this gonna happen now? When exactly do you mean? See I've already waited too long And now my hope is gone You shut your mouth How can you see I go back in the wrong way I am a human that I need to be loved Just like everybody else does I'm the sun in the air All the shabiness that is criminally robber I'm the sun in the air Of nothing in particular You shut your mouth How can you see I go back in the wrong way I am a human that I need to be loved
