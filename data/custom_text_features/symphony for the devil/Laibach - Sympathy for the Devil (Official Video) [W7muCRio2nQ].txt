 I was around when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and faith. And I made damn sure the pilot washed his hands and sealed his faith down. This mid-year I'd guess my name but was close like you. It's just nature, it's just nature of my dream. I stuck around some weird work when I saw it was starting to change. I killed the Zarb at his ministers in a stage of strength and weight. I broke down a jealous rank when the Blitz gray-rayed the ballistic. This mid-year I'd guess my name but was close like you. It's just nature of my game. I watched the dream while you kicked the cranes. But for ten decades the guts they made. I showed up, I killed the kindness. When and after all it was you and me. Let me please introduce myself. I'm a man of wealth and taste. And I laid traps for trueness. I can kill the fatherish bloodbath. This mid-year I'd guess my name but was close like you. It's just nature of my game. I'm a man of wealth and taste. I can kill the fatherish bloodbath. I can kill the fatherish bloodbath. I can kill the fatherish bloodbath. I can kill the fatherish bloodbath. I can kill the fatherish bloodbath. I can kill the fatherish bloodbath. This mid-year I'd guess my name but was close like you. It's just nature of my game. Justice and freedom. It's criminal. And all the sinners say it's a murder. As can it be just calling. Losing for the same in need of some restraints. So if you're with me have some consent. Have some sympathy and some taste. You saw how you were and the politics are in a yard. So bequests. ih ih ih ih ih You You You You You You You You You You You Thank you.
