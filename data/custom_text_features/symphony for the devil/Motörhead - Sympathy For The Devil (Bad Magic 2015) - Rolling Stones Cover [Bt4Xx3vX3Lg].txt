 The End. The End. The End. Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste. Been around for a long, long year, so many a man's soul to waste. I was around when Jesus Christ had his moments of doubt and pain. Made them sure that Pilate washed his hands and serious fate. Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name. Cause what's confusing you is just the nature of my game. I stood around St. Petersburg when my soul ached was the time for a change. I killed his heart and his ministers and the sasier screamed in vain. I learned a sign in a general's ring when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank. Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name. Cause what's personal in you is just the nature of my game. Come on, come on, come on. The End. The End. Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name. Cause what's confusing you is just the nature of my game. I worked with Lee Wally, the kings and queens for the ten decades, for the gods they made. I shouted out, who the other candidate is. When after all, there was you and me. Let me please introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste. Pilate drives for the truth of those who can kill me before they reach my name. Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name. Cause what's confusing you is just the nature of my game. Just as every cup is a criminal and all this innocence, as heads and tails just call me, lose the blood underneath of some restraint. So if you make me have some courtesy, have some sympathy and some taste, use all your unloved, protest or unmate your soul to waste. Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name. Cause what's confusing you is just the nature of my game. Oh yes, you guessed my name. Cause what's my name? Cause what's my name? Cause what's my name? Cause what's my name? Cause what's my name? Cause what's my name? Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! you you
