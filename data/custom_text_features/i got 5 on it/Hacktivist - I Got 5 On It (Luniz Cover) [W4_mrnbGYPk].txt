 PASS ME THE RISKS COURSE I'M READY TO BUILD! I'm the type that likes to smoke a fat joint like Cypress Hill! We roll through these with King Blues! Active chronic if I can use a bit of your back and you can go next on it! Go get your pee, I got five on it, that's a G, yeah that's bliss! We have a session rolling joints like a cigarette! So pass it across the table like ping pong, I'm gone! Beat in my chest like King Kong! It's all about my lips around the bevy! Cause when it comes to the lickers and bifters I'll sit many! Till I'm faded like a roast in berry! Smart to flame! Roses cherry to puff past! You won't get any! Unless you pull out the fat crispy! If you ain't got five on it then it ain't a pifty! Cause fools be having them vacuum lungs and if you let them have them free you hella die! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, no shit with that it's a weed! I got five on it, it's coming stuck in that shit! But I got five on it, burning lips going for the sale! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, got no phone, that's good King! I got five on it, no shit with that it's a weed! I got five on it, it's coming stuck in that shit! I got five on it, burning lips going for the sale!
