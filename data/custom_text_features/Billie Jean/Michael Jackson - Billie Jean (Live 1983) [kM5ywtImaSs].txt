 I I I.. I I'ma move this scene, I say don't mind but I'll get you, you mean I am the one. For a dance, I'll float around, she said I am the one. For a dance, I'll float around, she told me her thing could be the king, as she goes to sleep, then maybe the eyes can dream of me and the one. People always told me, be careful what you do, don't go around making young girls hard. And mother always told me, be careful who you love, be careful what you do, don't go around making young girls hard. For a dance, I'll float around, she told me her thing could be the king, as she goes to sleep, then maybe the eyes can dream of me and the one. For a fortnight, I was on a sand, I couldn't stand with these indipendence, these are the lands. For a dance, I'll float around, someday my strong advice, just remember you always say twice. For a dance, I'll float around, someday my strong advice, just remember you always say twice. For a dance, I'll float around, someday my strong advice, just remember you always say twice. Don't go around making young girls hard, cause the king is still right by me, cause as many as we've got room, I guess I'm gonna lose this room, cause she's gonna do me. For a dance, I'll float around, someday my strong advice, just remember you always say twice. She says I am the one, but the king is the number one. She says I am the one, but the king is the number one. The king is the number one, she's just a girl, but the I am the one, but the king is the number one. She says I am the one, but the king is the number one. She says I am the one, but the king is the number one. The queen is the number one, the queen is the number one. The queen is the number one. Thank you.
