 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Hello, is there anybody in there? Just not if you can hear me. Is there anyone home? Come on, come out. I hear you being down. Why can't he use your pain? Get you on your feet again. Relax, relax. Meet some information first. Just the basic facts. Can you show me where it hurts? There is no pain, you are receding. The dead is to chip smoke on the horizon. You are lonely coming through in ways. Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child, I had fever. My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again. I can't explain. You will not understand. This is not how I am. I have become comfortable enough. Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh you Thank you.
