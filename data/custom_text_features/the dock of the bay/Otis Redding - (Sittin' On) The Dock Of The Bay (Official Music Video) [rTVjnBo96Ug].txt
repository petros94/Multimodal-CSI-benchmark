 I'll be sitting in the evening come Watching the ships roll in I watch them roll away again, yeah I'm sitting on the darker bay Watching the tide roll away, ooh I'm just sitting on the darker bay Wasting time I left my home in Georgia, headed for the Frisco Bay Cause I've had nothing to live for, and it looked like nothing's gonna come my way So I'm just gonna sit on the darker bay, watching the tide roll away I'm sitting on the darker bay, wasting time Look like nothing's gonna change, everything still remains the same I can't do what ten people tell me to do, so I guess I'll remain the same I'm sitting here resting my bones, and this loneliness won't leave me alone Listen, two thousand miles I roam, just to make this a dark mind home Now I'm just gonna sit at the darker bay, watching the tide roll away Ooh, I'm just sitting on the darker bay, wasting time Whistling Whistling
