 Tonight more cloud cover with a low of 39. More rain tomorrow. Music playing. Birds chirping. No, no. Sound of birds. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Sitting in the morning sun. I'll be sitting when the evening comes. Watching the ships roll in. Then I want to blow the wind down. Sitting on a dark old bed. Watching the tide roll away. Sitting on a dark old bed. Ways and time. That's my home in Georgia. Had a long, different story babe. I had nothing to live for. Looks like nothing's gonna cut my way. I'm just gonna sit on the dark old bed. Watching the tide roll away. Sitting on the dark old bed. Ways and time. Looks like nothing's gonna change now. Everything, everything remains the same. I can't do what 10 people tell me I can do. I can't do what 10 people tell me. Music playing. Looks like nothing's ever gonna change. Loud everything remains the same. I can't do what 10 people tell me to do. So I guess I'll remain the same. I'm sitting there rifting my bones. And the loudness won't leave me alone. 2000 miles are wrong. Just to make this dark my home. I'm just gonna sit on the dark old bed. Watching the tide roll away. Watching the tide roll away. I'm not gonna make the way. I'm just gonna sit on the dark old bed. Music playing.
