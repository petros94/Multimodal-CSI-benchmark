 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Time, time, time. See what's become of me. Music playing. Time, time, time. See what's become of me. While I looked around for my possibilities. I was so hard to please. Look around, it leaves a brown and a sky. Is a hazy, shady winter. In the sun, there should not be a path. Down by the roadside, it's about to be a better ride. Then what you got planned? Carry a cup in your hand. Look around, it leaves a brown and a sky. Is a hazy, shady winter. Hang out to your homes, my friend. That's the easy thing to say, but if your hopes are passed away. Definitely pretend that you can build them again. Look around, the ground is high. Feel the light, it's the sweet time of my life. Oh, season's changed with a scenery. Weaving time in a tempest train. Won't you stop and remember me. Music playing. Look around, it leaves a brown and a sky. Is a hazy, shady winter. Look around, it leaves a brown and a patch of snow. Look around, it leaves a brown and a patch of snow. Look around, it leaves a brown and a patch of snow. Music playing.
