 Time, time, time, see what's become of me. While I lived around for my possibilities, I was so hard to please. The ground needs a ground and the sky is a hazy shade of winter. In a salvation only band, Down by the seaside is bound to be a better hide than what you've got planned. Carry your cup in your hand. The ground needs a ground and the sky is a hazy shade of winter. Hang on to your hopes, my friend. That's the least you can say, but if you hope you'll pass away, Simply pretend that you can build them again. The ground, the grass is high, it feels alright. This is springtime of my life. Seasons change with the scenery, Leaving time in a tapestry. Won't you stop and remember me? Time, time, time, see what's become of me. Look around, there's a ground and the sky is a hazy shade of winter. Look around, there's a ground, there's a patch of snow on the ground. Look around, there's a ground, there's a patch of snow on the ground. Look around, there's a ground, there's a patch of snow on the ground. you Thank you.
