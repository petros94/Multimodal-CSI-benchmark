 Regrets collect like old friends Here to relieve your darkest moments I can't see no way, I can't see no way And all of the ghosts come out to play I never redeem and once he's pound of flesh But I like to keep some things to myself I like to keep my issues wrong It's always dark as before the dawn I've been a fool and I've been blind I could never leave the past behind I can't see no way, I can't see no way I'm always dragging that horse around All of its flesh is such a wonderful sound Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground So I like to keep my issues drawn It's always dark as before the dawn Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out And it's hard to dance with a double on your back So shake it off Oh wow, I am done with my graceless heart So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart Cause I like to keep my issues drawn It's always dark as before the dawn Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out Oh wow, and it's hard to dance with a double on your back So shake it off Oh wow And it's hard to dance with a double on your back Give him half the chance, would I take any of it back? It's a fun romance, but it's left me so undone It's always dark as before the dawn Oh wow, and I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't So here's a drink in the dark at the end of my road And I'm ready to suffer, I'm ready to hope And it's a shot in the dark, aimed right at my throat Cause looking for heaven, found a devil in me I'm looking for heaven, found a devil in me Well what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me Oh wow, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out And it's hard to dance with a double on your back So shake it off Oh wow, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out Oh wow, and it's hard to dance with a double on your back So shake it off Oh wow Hi, thank you very much for watching.
