 Regrets collect like old friends Need to relive your darkest moments I can see no way, I can see no way And all of the ghouse come out to play And every dimmer wants his pound of fish I like to keep some things to myself I like to keep my issues strong It's always darkest before the dawn And I've been a fool and I've been blind I can never live the past behind I can see no way, I can see no way I'm always dragging that horse around Our love's past, it's such a mournful sound Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse and look around I like to keep my issues strong It's always darkest before the dawn Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out Had a talk to dance without your guts So shake him off I am done with my bracelets on Tonight I'm gonna cut it out and let me scar Cause I like to keep my issues strong It's always darkest before the dawn Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out Had a talk to dance without your guts So shake him off Had a talk to dance without your back Given half the chance, what I take any of It's a fine mess, but it's left me so undone It's always darkest before the dawn I'm gonna dance if I do, but what you tell me if I go There's some things that are dark at the end of my room I'm glad you just suffer, I'm already too alone It's a shot of the dark and I'm high up my phone Looking for heaven, falling down in need Looking for heaven, falling down in need Well, what the hell am I gonna let it happen to me? Had a talk to dance without your back So shake him off Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out Had a talk to dance without your back So shake him off Had a talk to dance without your back Given half the chance, what I take any of It's a fine mess, but it's left me so undone It's always darkest before the dawn you Whooo!
