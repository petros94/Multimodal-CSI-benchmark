 Regrets collect like old friends, it's a real end, you're a darkest moment, I can see no way, I can see no way, all of the ghosts come out of the dark. All of the ghosts come out to play, every demon wants his pound of flesh, I like to keep some things to myself, I like to keep my issues strong, it's always darkest before the dawn. I've not been a fool and I've been blind, I can never leave the past behind, I can see no way, I can see no way. I'm always dragging that horse around, our love is constant, such a mournful sound, but tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground, cause I like to keep my issues strong, it's always darkest before the dawn. Oh oh, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh oh, and it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off, oh oh. I am done with my graceless heart, so tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart, cause I like to keep my issues strong, it's always darkest before the dawn. Oh oh, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh oh, and it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off, oh oh. And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so give him half the chance, but I take any of it back, it's a final mess, but it's left me so undone, it's always darkest before the dawn. And I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't, so here's the drinks in the dark at the end of my road, I'm ready to suffer, I'm ready to hope, it's a shot in the dark and right at my throat, cause looking for heaven, find a devil in me, looking for heaven, find a devil in me, but what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me. Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh oh, and it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off, oh oh. Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, oh oh, and it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off, oh oh. Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh. Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh. Thank you for watching!
