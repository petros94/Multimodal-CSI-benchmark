 When the moon is in a several pounds, And Jupiter lines with Mars, Then please, don't die for fairness, And love will steer the stars. This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius, Aquarius, Aquarius, Aquarius! How many understanding, Seem of the atroast of body, Colorful for the tundrations, Golden living greens of vision, Mystic crystal revelations, And the mind's true liberation, Aquarius, Aquarius! When the moon is in a several pounds, And Jupiter lines with Mars, Then please, don't die for fairness, And love will steer the stars. This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius, Age of Aquarius! Aquarius, Aquarius, Aquarius! Let the sunshine, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Let the sunshine in, Hey, you got the feeling, You got the feeling, When you open up your heart, You gotta let the sun glow in, Like I say in the morning, The lady in the evening, I will let you know, Hey, when you feel alone.
