 If you are the dealer, then I'm out of the game. If you are the healer, I must be broken and lame. If I am the glory of mine, must be the shame. If you wanted darker, we kill the flame. Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name. Vileified, crucified in the human frame. A million candles burning for the help that never came. If you wanted darker, in any, in any, I'm ready, my Lord. There's a lover in the story, but the story's still the same. There's a lullaby in the suffering and a paradox to blame. And it's written in the scriptures, but it's not some idle claim. If you wanted darker, we kill the flame. They're lining up the prisoners and the guards are taking aim. I struggled with some demons, they were middle class and tame. I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim. Me, you wanted darker. In any, in any, I'm ready, my Lord. Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name. Vileified, crucified in the human frame. A million candles burning for the love that never came. You wanted darker, we kill the flame. If you are the dealer, let me out of the game. If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame. If I was the glory, might must be the shame. You wanted darker. In any, in any, in any, in any, in any, in any. I'm ready, my Lord. We kill the flame. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
