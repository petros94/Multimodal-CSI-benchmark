 If you want to know more about the new world, please check out the description below. If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game. If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame. If thine is the glory, then mine must be the shame. You want it darker, we kill the flame. Magnified, sanctified be thy holy name. Millified, crucified in the human frame. A million candles burning for the help that never came. You want it darker. In any, any, I'm ready my lord. There's a lover in the story, but the story's still the same. There's a lullaby for suffering and a paradox to blame. But it's written in the scriptures and it's not some idle claim. You want it darker. We kill the flame. They're lining up the prisoners and the guards who take an aim. I struggled with some demons. They were middle class and tape. I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim. You want it darker. In any, any, I'm ready my lord. Magnified, sanctified be thy holy name. Millified, crucified in the human frame. A million candles burning for the love that never came. You want it darker. We kill the flame. If you want the dealer, let me out of the game. If you want the healer, I'm broken and lame. If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame. You want it darker. In any, any, I'm ready my lord. In any, any, I'm ready. I am. Thank you.
