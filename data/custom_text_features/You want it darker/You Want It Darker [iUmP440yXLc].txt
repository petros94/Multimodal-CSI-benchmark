In any mania, I'm ready my Lord Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name Vileified, crucified in the human frame A million candles burning for the love that never came, you want a duck, huh? We killed the flame And if you are the deal, let me out of the game If you are the healer, means I'm broken and lame If thine is the glory, then mine must be the shame You want a duck, huh? In any mania, I'm ready my Lord I'm ready my Lord In any mania In any mania In any mania In any mania In any mania In any mania In any mania In any mania In any mania In any mania
