 If you are the dealer, I am out of the game. If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame. If thine is the glory, then mine must be the shame. You own it darker, we kill the flame. Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name. Villified, crucified, in the human frame. A million candles burning for the help that never came. You own it darker. He nanny, he nanny. I'm ready, my lord. There's a lover in the story, but the story's still the same. There's a lullaby for suffering and a paradox to blame. But it's written in the scriptures and it's not some idle claim. You own it darker. We kill the flame. There lie the nocturne prisoners and the gods are taking aim. I struggled with some demons. They were middle class and tame. I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim. You own it darker. He nanny, he nanny. I'm ready, my lord. He nanny, he nanny. Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name. Villified, crucified, in the human frame. A million candles burning for the love that never came. You own it darker. We kill the flame. If you are the dealer, let me out of the game. If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame. Thine is the glory. Mine must be the shame. You own it darker. He nanny, he nanny. He nanny, he nanny. I'm ready, my lord. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, my lord. I'm ready, my lord. I'm ready. you Thank you.
