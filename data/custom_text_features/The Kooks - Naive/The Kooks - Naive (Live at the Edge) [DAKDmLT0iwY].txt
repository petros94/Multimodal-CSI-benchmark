 I'm not saying it was your fault, oh no you could've done more This whole life gets so, how could this be done by such a smiling sweetheart? Oh and that sweet empty face is such an ugly way for something so beautiful That every time I look inside I know she knows that I'm not fond of us True or false it may be, she's still out to get me And I know she knows that I'm not fond of us True or false it may be, she's still out to get me I may say it was your fault, because I know you could've done more This whole life gets so, how could this be done by such a smiling sweetheart? Oh and that sweet empty face is such an ugly way for something so beautiful That every time I look inside I know she knows that I'm not fond of us True or false it may be, she's still out to get me And I know she knows that I'm not fond of us True or false it may be, she's still out to get me Yeah I'm not saying it was your fault, oh no you could've done more This whole life gets so, how could this be done by such a sweet heart? Oh and that every time you're on his side I know she knows that I'm not fond of us True or false it may be, she's still out to get me I know that she knows that I'm not fond of us True or false it may be, she's still out to get me Just don't let me down Just don't let me down, oh no to your kind Just don't let me down Just don't let me down, oh no to your kind Just don't let me down Just don't let me down, oh no to your kind Just don't let me down Just don't let me down you
