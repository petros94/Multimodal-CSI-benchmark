 A long long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew that if I had my chance I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while Did you write the book of love? And do you have faith in God above? If the Bible tells you so Now do you believe in rock and roll And can music save your mortal soul? And can it teach me how to dance real slow? Well I know that you're in love with Him Cause I saw you dancing in the gym You both kicked off your shoes And it did tell me to make blues I was a lonely teenage drunk who loved With a pink carnation and a brick of chocolate I knew that I was out of luck Good day, the music died I started singing Bye bye, Muslim-American life Drowning a Chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good old boys would drink you whiskey and ride Singing this will be the day that I die This will be the day that I die I'm the girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away Well I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play Well now in the streets the children scream The lovers cry and the poets dream But not a word was spoken The church bells were broken And the freemen I admire the most The father's son and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast Good day, the music died We started singing Bye bye, Muslim-American life Drowning a Chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good old boys would drink you whiskey and ride Singing this will be the day that I die This will be the day that I die This will be the day that I die Bye bye, Muslim-American life Drowning a Chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good old boys would drink you whiskey and ride Singing this will be the day that I die This will be the day that I die We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing you
