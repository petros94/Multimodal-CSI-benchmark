 Music playing. You were my sun, you were my earth But you didn't know all the ways I looked at you, no So you took a chance, you made a difference But I bet you didn't think that they were crashing down You don't have to say what you did, I already know I found out from head, now there's just no chance For you and me, they'll never be And don't make you sad about it You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone Girl I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy The bridges were burned, now it's your turn to cry Call me a river, call me a river You know that they said that something's a better life I said It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it All of these things people told me came this way with my head Should've picked honesty then you may not have flown me away You don't have to say what you did, I already know I found out from head, now there's just no chance For you and me, they'll never be And don't make you sad about it You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone Girl I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy The bridges were burned, now it's your turn to cry Call me a river, call me a river The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leaving The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leaving The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leaving The damage is done, I guess I'll be leaving You don't have to say what you did, I already know I found out from head, now there's just no chance For you and me, they'll never be And don't make you sad about it Call me a river, baby call me a river You can't call me a river, call me a river Baby go on and just, go on and just, because I already cried Call me a river, call me a river Call me a river, call me a river Call me a river, call me a river Call me a river, call me a river Hey guys thanks for watching our cover of Cry Me a River by Justin Timberlake If you want to show some extra support like our friend David Swanson Click the link in the description to join our Patreon Don't forget you can find this entire Cusick EP on all streaming platforms Remember to check out our website, first211.com Or you can find physical copies of all of our cover CDs as well as t-shirts and hoodies Make sure you like, subscribe and comment any songs you'd like to see us do down below
