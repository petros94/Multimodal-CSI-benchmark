 You were my sun, you were my earth But you didn't know the ways I loved you, I know you took a chance and made other plans But I feel you didn't think that they would come crashing down You don't have to say what you did I already know I found out from him Now there's just no chance for you and me He'll never be, don't it make you sad about it You told me you loved me, why didn't you leave me all alone Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone Now I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy Your bridges were burned and now it's your turn to cry, cry me a river, cry me a river, yeah I know they say some things I've been left unsaid It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it Don't knock like you don't know it All these things people tell me keep messing with my head You should have picked honesty and you might not have blown it You don't have to say what you did I already know I found out from him Now there's just no chance for you and me They'll never be, and don't it make you sad about it You told me you loved me, why didn't you leave me all alone Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone And now I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy Your bridges were burned and now it's your turn Cry me river, cry me river, cry me river, cry me river, cry me river, cry me river, cry me river, baby The damage is done so I guess I believe it, oh, yeah the damage is done so I guess I believe it, oh Well the damage is done so I guess I believe it, oh, well the damage is done so I guess I believe it I did. Thank you.
