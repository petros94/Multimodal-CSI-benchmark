 You were my son, you were my mother, you were my son. You were my urn, you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no. So you took a chance, made of a plan, but I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no. You don't have to say what you did, I already know, I don't have luck, yeah. If there's just no chance, would you give me, they'll never be. They don't even make you sad about it. You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone? Now you tell me you need me, and you call me on the phone. Girl I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy. Bridges for birth, now it's your turn to cry. Tell me you're rid of girls, tell me you're rid of girls. I know that they say that some things are better than that of a set. But he wasn't like you, only talk to him and you know it. Don't act like you don't know it. All of these things people told me, keep messing with my head. Should've picked honesty, then you may not have thought it through. You don't have to say what you did, I already know, I don't have luck, yeah. If there's just no chance, would you give me, they'll never be. And don't even make you sad about it. You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone? Now you tell me you need me, and you call me on the phone. Girl I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy. I'd like them baby, the bridges go burn, now it's your turn to cry. Tell me you're rid of girls, tell me you're rid of girls. The damages done, so I guess I'll be leaving. You don't have to say what you did, I already know, I don't have luck, yeah. If there's just no chance, would you give me, they'll never be. Don't even make you sad about it, tell me you're rid of girls. Tell me you're rid of girls, tell me you're rid of girls. Oh, cry me a river.
