 Oh, misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful what's off my brother's sores Answer the sky, be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over, doing something If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out for the wrong, stand by and we will Watch the flames burn over long, mountains inside high And if we should die tonight, then we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out for the wrong, prepare as we will Watch the flames burn over long, mountains inside high There's a lace on, comes upon the sky No, I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees I see fire following souls I see fire burning the trees And I hope that you'll remember me Who should my people for them? We all do the same, confined in mountain halls We got too close to the flame Calling out for the wrong, hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn over long, mountains inside There's a lace on, comes upon the sky No, I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees I see fire following souls I see fire burning the trees And I hope that you'll remember me And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes For if the dark reaches them, our brothers will die Unless the sky's falling down, it's crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow on the ground, I hear my people scream, No, I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees I see fire following souls I see fire, blood in the ring No, I see fire, where you know I saw a city burning out No, I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin No, I see fire No, I see fire over on the mountainside Translated by Releska
