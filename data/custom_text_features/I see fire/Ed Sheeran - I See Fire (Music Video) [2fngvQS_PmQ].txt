 Oh, misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful watch of my brother's souls And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over your insides If this is to end in fire Then we shall all burn together Watch the flames climb high Into the night Calling out Father O Simba and we will watch the flames burn Obenor the mountainside high And if we should die tonight Then we should all die together Raise a glass of wine For the last time Calling out Father O Prepare as we will Watch the flames burn obenor The mountainside Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire Inside the mountain I see fire Burning the trees and I see fire Hollow in soul I see fire Blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me Oh, should my people fold in Should we all do the same Come find in mountain holes We got too close to the flame Calling out Father O Hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn obenor The mountainside Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire Inside the mountain I see fire Burning the trees and I see fire Hollow in soul I see fire Blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes For if the dark wind turns Then my brothers will die And thus the sky is falling down It crushed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming now Now I see fire Inside the mountain I see fire Burning the trees and I see fire Hollow in soul I see fire Blood in the breeze I see fire Oh, we know it's our city burn And I see fire Feel the heat upon my skin And I see fire And I see fire burn obenor The mountainside The Mountainside Thank you.
