 We're gonna trap, I can't walk out Because I love you too much baby Why can't you see what you've done to me When you don't believe what I say We can't go on again, with just a precious mind And we can't be here that day, I just think that's just my heart Children of friend I know Stop men saying hello We're asked to see you, especially in your eyes There you go again, ask it where I'm at You can't see me, just I cry We can't go on again, with just a precious mind And we can't be here that day, I just think that's just my heart Oh, let me know how to see you back I can drive until you're quiet Don't let this stupid lie, you know I have never lied to you No, no, no, we're gonna trap, I can't walk out Because I love you too much baby Why can't you see what you've done to me When you don't believe what I say We can't go on again, with just a precious mind And we can't be here that day, I just think that's just my heart Don't let this stupid lie, you know I have never lied to you No, no, no, we're gonna trap, I can't walk out When you don't believe what I say I'm gonna trap, and have a hand walk out Because I love you too much baby Why can't you see what you've done to me When you don't believe what I say you
