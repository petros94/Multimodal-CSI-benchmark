 I don't know what it is that makes me love you so I only know I never wanna let you go I'm sure you started something that you see That ever since we met you had a hold on me It happens to be true, I only wanna be with you It doesn't matter where you go or what you do I wanna spend each moment of the day with you What has happened? Just one kiss I never knew that I could be in love like this It's crazy but it's true, I only wanna be with you You stopped smiling at me, asked if I cared to dance I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance At first and finally I just wanna be beside you everywhere As long as we're together, honey, I don't care You started something that you see That ever since we met you had a hold on me No matter what you do, I only wanna be with you You stopped smiling at me, asked if I cared to dance I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance At first and finally I just wanna be beside you everywhere As long as we're together, honey, I don't care You started something that you see That ever since we met you had a hold on me No matter what you do, I only wanna be with you No matter what you do, I only, I only, I only wanna be with you Thank you for watching!
