 I don't know what it is that makes me love you so I only know I never want to let you go Cause you started something, oh can't you see That ever since we met you've had a hold on me It happens to be true, I only want to be with you It doesn't matter where you go or what you do I want to spend each moment of the day with you Well look what has happened with just one kiss I never knew that I could be in love like this It's crazy but it's true, I only want to be with you You start and smiled at me and asked if I'd care to dance I fell into your open arms I didn't stand to judge I just want to be beside you everywhere As long as we're together honey I don't care Cause you started something, oh can't you see That ever since we met you've had a hold on me No matter what you do I only want to be with you Thanks for watching!
