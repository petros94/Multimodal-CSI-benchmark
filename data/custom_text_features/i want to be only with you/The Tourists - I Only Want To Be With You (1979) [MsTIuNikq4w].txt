 I don't know what it is that makes me love you so I only know I never wanna let you go Cause you started something, well can't you see Never since we met you've had a hold on me And how it happens to be true I only wanna be with you Doesn't matter where you go or what you do I want a Spanish woman on the day we're together I don't know what it is that makes me love you so I never knew that I could be in love like this It's crazy but it's true I only wanna be with you You stopped a smile of me Asked me my care to dance I fell into your open arms And I didn't spend a chance No listen honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere As long as we're together honey, I don't care Cause you started something, well can't you see Never since we met you've had a hold on me And how it happens to be true I only wanna be with you I just wanna be beside you everywhere As long as we're together honey, I don't care Cause you started something, well can't you see Never since we met you've had a hold on me No matter what you do I only wanna be with you No matter what you do I only, I only, I only, I only, I only wanna be with you
