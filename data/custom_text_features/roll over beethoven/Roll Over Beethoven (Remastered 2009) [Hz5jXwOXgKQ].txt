 I'm gonna ride a little ladder, gonna mail it to my local DJ It's a rocky little record, I want my jockey to play Roll over beat open, gotta hear it again today You know my temperature's rising, out the tube I suppose it pews A heartbeat rhythm, and my soul beats a-singin' the blues Roll over beat open, I tell it she can't scare the blues I've got a rocky pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm, my blues I think I call it out the rider, sittin' down by the rhythm of you Roll over beat open, lockin' in two by two Well if you feel it like it, get your lover unreal and rock it Roll it over and move on up just, drive it further unreal and rock it Roll it over, roll over beat open, rockin' in two by two Roll it over Early in the morning, I'ma give it you the morning, don't you say for my blues where you choose Hey, little, little, I play my fill, ain't got nothing to lose Roll over beat open, I tell it she can't scare the blues You know she wakes like a glow, and dance like a space star She's got a crazy partner, all to see in you, even rock But she's got a dime, the music will never stop Roll over beat open, roll over beat open Roll over beat open, roll over beat open, roll over beat open, tick to the rhythm of blues Roll over beat open, roll over beat open, roll over beat open, roll over beat open
