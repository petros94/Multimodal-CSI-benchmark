 Black, black, black is the color of my true love's hair. Her lips are something rosy fair. The upper-dice face and the day here stands. I love the gross where auntie stands. I love my love and well she knows. I love the gross where auntie goes. If she honors no more I see, my life will quickly leave me. I go to troublesome to mong to weep, but satisfied I know how to sleep. Here are few little lines on the supper desk. Ten thousand times. Black, black, black is the color of my true love's hair. Her lips are something rosy fair. The upper-dice face and the day here stands. I love the gross where auntie stands. I love the gross where auntie goes.
