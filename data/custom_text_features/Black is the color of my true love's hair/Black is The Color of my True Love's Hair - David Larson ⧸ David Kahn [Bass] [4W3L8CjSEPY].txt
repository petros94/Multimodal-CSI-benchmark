 I'm sorry. Black is the color of my truth of sin. Her face so soft and wondrous pale. The purest eyes and the jade-paste hands. I love the ground on which she stands. I love the ground on which she stands. Black is the color of my truth of sin. I love my love in which she goes. I love the ground on which she goes. And still I know that the time will come. Still I know that the time will come. When she and I will be as one. Black is the color of my truth of sin. I love the ground on which she goes.
