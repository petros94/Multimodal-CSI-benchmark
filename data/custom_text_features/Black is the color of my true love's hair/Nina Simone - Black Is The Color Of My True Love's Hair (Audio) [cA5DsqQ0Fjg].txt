 Black is the color of my true love's hair. His face so soft and wondrous pale. My purest eyes and the strongest hands. I love the ground on where he stands. Black is the color of my true love's hair. Of my true love's hair. Oh love, my lover and well he knows. Yes I love the ground on where he goes. And still I hope that the time will come. When he and I will be as one. Oh black is the color of my true love's hair. Of my true love's hair. Oh black is the color of my true love's hair.
