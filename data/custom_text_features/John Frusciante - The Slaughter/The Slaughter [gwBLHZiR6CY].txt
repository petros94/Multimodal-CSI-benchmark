 I know how things are not always right I know how things are not always right I know how things are not always right You'll be there in the slaughter, free when I'm cornered Been arrested by the mine cops They're the only ones with change in what you do for And I try to be in line I got my faith in what it's good for There's no telling, it's blood, it's a flood I know how things are not always right I know how things are not always right Living there in a flower, you won't be made it without her Though she seems to stay in one place, she grows with your life So cry for time, what's slow is fast at the same time It comes to life And if it dies, you never notice cause it It slides as it climbs I know how things are not always right Now I know my pain's a life away I know how things are not always right I know how things are not always right I know how things are not always right I know how things are not always right
