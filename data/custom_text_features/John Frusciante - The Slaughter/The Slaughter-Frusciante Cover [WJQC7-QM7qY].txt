 I'm no her face, no my whole way I'm no her face, no my whole way I'm no her face, no my whole way I'm no her face, no my whole way You'll be there in the slaughter, bring me where the corner, being arrested by the mind Cause they're the only ones who are changing what you do for And I try, being alive, I got my name and what it's good for There's no telling, it's blood, it's a blood I'm no her face, no my whole way, tell me straight to the game Living there in a flower, what a living and I, those six-day-wondless she grows with your life So cry for time, it's always past that same time It comes to life, and in the time you've never known it's cause it inspires as it climbs I'm no her face, no my whole way, I'm no her face, no my whole way I'm no her face, no my whole way, I'm no her face, no my whole way I'm no her face, no my whole way, I'm no her face, no my whole way I'm no her face, no my whole way, I'm no her face, no my whole way
