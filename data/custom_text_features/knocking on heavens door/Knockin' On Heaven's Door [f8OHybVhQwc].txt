 Music playing. Music playing. Mama take this bath for me. Music playing. I can't use it anymore. Music playing. Getting dark to dark to see. Music playing. Feels like I'm nothing on here to do. Music playing. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Hey hey hey hey hey hey. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Oh yeah. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Oh yeah. Music playing. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Music playing. Mama put my guns in the ground. I can't shoot them anymore. That cold black cloud is coming down. Feels like I'm nothing on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Hey hey hey hey hey. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Hey hey hey hey hey. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Hey hey hey hey hey. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Knock knock knocking on heaven's door. Oh yeah. Music playing.
