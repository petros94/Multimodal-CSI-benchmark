 Music playing. Music playing. I see a clinic full of cynics Who want to twist the people's wrists They're watching every move we make We're all included on their list The lunatics have taken over the asylum Go nuclear the cowboy told us And who am I to disagree Cause when the madman flicks a switch The nuclear will go for me The lunatics have taken over the asylum Music playing. I see the faces of starvation But I just cannot see the point Cause there's so much food here today That no one wants to take away The lunatics have taken over the asylum The lunatics have taken over the asylum The lunatics have taken over the asylum The lunatics have taken over the asylum you Thank you.
