 Just a perfect day, drinks angrier in the pour, Then later when it gets dark we go home. Just a perfect day, feed animals in the zoo, Then later when we turn and then home. Oh yeah, such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you. Such a perfect day, you just keep me in, you just keep me in. Just a perfect day, problems all left alone, Weekenders on our own, such fun. Just a perfect day, you made me forget myself, I thought you were someone else, someone girl. Oh yeah, such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you. Such a perfect day, you just keep me hanging on, you just keep me hanging on. Just a perfect day, you made me forget myself, You're gonna be just what Jesus is. You're gonna be just what Jesus is. You're gonna be just what Jesus is. You're gonna be just what Jesus is. You're gonna be just what Jesus is. You're gonna be just what Jesus is. You can't be just one.
