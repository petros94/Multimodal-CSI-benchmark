 Just a perfect day, drink sangria in the park, and then later, when it gets dark we go home. Just a perfect day, feed animals in the zoo, then later, a movie too and then home. Oh it's such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you. Oh such a perfect day, you just keep me hanging on, you just keep me hanging on. Just a perfect day, problems all left alone, weekenders on our own, it's such fun. Just a perfect day, you made me forget myself, I thought I was someone else, someone good. Oh it's such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you. Oh such a perfect day, you just keep me hanging on, you just keep me hanging on. Oh such a perfect day, you just keep me hanging on. You're going to read, just watch your soul. You're going to read, just watch your soul. You're going to read, just watch your soul.
