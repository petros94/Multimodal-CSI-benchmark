 I I I I don't know what your eyes have, I don't know what your mouth has. I have my saints in my hands, and my blood is going crazy. I don't know how I fell in love with you, or how I loved you. I feel like dying a thousand times when I'm not looking at you. At night when I'm asleep, I ask God to forgive you, and to dawn awake, so alone to give you. What influence do your lips have, that when I wake up they make me feel like a slave, and love for the universe. God! At night when I'm asleep, I ask God to forgive you, and to dawn awake, so alone to give you. What influence do your lips have, that when I wake up they make me feel like a slave, and love for the universe. you you
