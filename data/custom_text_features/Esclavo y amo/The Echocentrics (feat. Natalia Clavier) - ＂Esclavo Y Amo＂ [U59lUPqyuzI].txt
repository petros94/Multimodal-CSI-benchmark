 Music I don't know what your eyes have I don't know what your mouth has What do my holy eyes look like And my blood goes crazy again I don't know how I was to believe you Or how I was to adore you I feel like dying a thousand times When I'm not calling you The night when I fall asleep I say goodbye, I forget you And I wake up in the morning So lonely to adore you The influence comes from your lips That when they kiss I understand And they make me feel like a slave And love, from the universe Music I don't know when I fall asleep I say goodbye, I forget you And I wake up in the morning So lonely to adore you The influence comes from your lips That when they kiss I understand And they make me feel like a slave And love, from the universe you Thank you.
