 She keeps him away from Shondor and a pretty cabinet, let them be cakes she says. Just like Marie Antoinette, a building remedy for the first job and energy and a talent imitation you can't deny. Carry all your cigarettes well-bursted in any kind, extraordinary night. She's a killer, cream gun body, gelatin, dynamite, with a laser beam, guaranteed to blow your mind. You recommend it at the price, it's satiable and appetite, wanna try? Avoid complications, she never kept the same address, in conversation, she spoke just like a Baroness, middleman, try to open down to Gays, she might have been again accidentally in your blackwear creed. I love you, came naturally from Paris, naturally, because she couldn't care less, but still you said precise. She's a killer, cream gun body, gelatin, dynamite, with a laser beam, guaranteed to blow your mind. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Drop of a hat, Jesus willing as, pray for us to pussycat. The momentarily out of action, temporarily out of time. That's what's so ugly. Try to hide. She's wild to get you. She's a killer, creep, gunfight, and jeopardy. Dynamite with a laser beam, galaxy, it's a borderline. Diminitize. You're recommended of a price, insatiable and appetite. Run and try. Run and try.. await our next episode. Thank you so much. Thanks for being here. I hope you got wheres that button? Yeah. Thank you All. I hope you got it. Thank you.
