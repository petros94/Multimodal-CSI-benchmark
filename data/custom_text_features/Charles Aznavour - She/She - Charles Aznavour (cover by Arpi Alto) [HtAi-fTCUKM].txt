 She may be the face I can't forget The trace of pleasure or regret Maybe my treasure or the price I have to pay She may be the sound that summer sings Maybe the chill that autumn brings Maybe the hundred different things Within the measure of the day She may be the beauty or the best Maybe the feminine or the face Later each day into a heaven or hell She may be the mirror of my dreams The smile reflected in a string She may not be what she makes him inside herself She always seems so happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be so private and so proud No one's allowed to see them when they cry She may be their love that cannot help to last Make them to me from shadows in the past That I remember till the day I die She may be the reason I survive The one wherefore I'm alive The one I'll care for through the room In many years Really I'll take her laughter in her tears And make them all my sleep And when she goes I've got to be The meaning of my life is she The meaning of my life is she I'll take her laughter in her tears Transcribed by ESO, translated by â€”
