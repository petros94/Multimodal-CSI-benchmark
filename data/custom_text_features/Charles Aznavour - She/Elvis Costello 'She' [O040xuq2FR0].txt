 and I will be back. Thank you. She may be the face I can't forget, the trace of pleasure or regret. Maybe my treasure or the prize I have to pay. She may be the song the summer sings, maybe the chill the autumn brings. Maybe a hundred different things within the measure of a day. She may be the beauty of the beast, maybe the famine or the feast. May turn each day into a heaven or a hell. She may be the mirror of my dreams, a smile reflected in a stream. She may not be what she may seem inside a shell. She may be the light of my dreams, a smile reflected in a stream. She may not be what she may seem inside a shell. She may not be what she may seem inside a shell. She may not be what she may seem inside a shell. She may not be what she may seem inside a shell. She may not be what she may seem inside a shell. She may be the reason I survive, the one I'm waiting for. I'm alive, the one I've cared for through the rough and ready years. Me, I'll take her laughter in her tears and make them all my souvenirs. Where she goes, I've got to be. The meaning of my life is she. She. She. She. you Thank you.
