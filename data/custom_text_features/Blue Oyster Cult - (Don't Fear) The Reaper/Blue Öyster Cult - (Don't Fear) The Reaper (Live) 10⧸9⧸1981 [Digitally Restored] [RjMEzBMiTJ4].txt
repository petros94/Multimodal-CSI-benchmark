Here's a song from our agent to Portugal. Love and time is good. Here's a song from our agent to Portugal. Love to this one. Here but now let it go. We've been feeling last night of sadness. It was clear she couldn't go on. When the door was open and the wind appeared. The candles blew and the days appeared. The curtains flew and the heat flew. She had to be afraid. Come on baby, she had no fear. She ran to him. Let her back when he said she'd find her. She had to come out of there. She had to come out of there. Come on baby, don't fear the reason. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love.
