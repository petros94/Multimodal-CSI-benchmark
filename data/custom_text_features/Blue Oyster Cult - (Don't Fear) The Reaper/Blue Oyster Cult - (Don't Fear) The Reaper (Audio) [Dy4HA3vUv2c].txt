 All our times have come Fear but now they're gone Seasons don't feel the river Not do the wind, the sun or the rain We could be like they are Come on baby, don't feel the river Baby, take my hand Don't feel the river We'll be able to fly Don't feel the river Baby, I'm your man La la la la la La la la la la Valentine has gone Fear but now they're gone Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity 40,000 men and women every day 40,000 men and women every day 40,000 men and women every day They'll be like they are Come on baby, don't feel the river Baby, take my hand Don't feel the river We'll be able to fly Don't feel the river Baby, I'm your man La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la Love up to his heart Fear but now they're gone Came the last night of sadness And it was clear she couldn't go on The door was open and the wind appeared The candles blew and then disappeared The curtains flew and then he appeared Come on baby, don't feel the river And she ran to him They left back what he said goodbye She had taken his hand Come on baby, don't feel the river La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la La la la la la you Thank you.
