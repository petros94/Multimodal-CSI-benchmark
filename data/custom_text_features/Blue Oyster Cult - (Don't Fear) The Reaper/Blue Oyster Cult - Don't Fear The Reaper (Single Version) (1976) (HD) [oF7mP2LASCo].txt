 All of times have come, Here, but now they've come, Seasons don't come, Seasons don't feel the river, Not due to wind, the sun or the rain, We can be like they are, Come on baby, don't feel the river, Baby take my hand, don't feel the river, We'll be able to fly, don't feel the river, Baby I'm the man, La la la la la, Valentine has done, Here, but now they've come, Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity, 40,000 men are women every day, 40,000 men are women every day, And every 40,000 come in every day, Come on baby, don't feel the river, Baby take my hand, don't feel the river, We'll be able to fly, don't feel the river, Baby I'm the man, La la la la la, La la la la la, Up up to where it's gone, Here but now they've come, Came the last night of sadness, And it was clear she couldn't go on, The door was open at the window, The candles blew and then disappeared, The curtains flew and then reappeared, Said don't be afraid, Come on baby, now she's not gonna be here, She ran to the moon, Then the backwood said she'd buy, She had taken it to heaven, Come on baby, don't feel the river, La la la la la la,
