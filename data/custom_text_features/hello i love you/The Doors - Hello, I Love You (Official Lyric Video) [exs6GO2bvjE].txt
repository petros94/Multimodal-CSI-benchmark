 Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name Hello, I love you left me jump in your game Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name Hello, I love you left me jump in your game She's walking down the street, blind to every eye she meets Do you think you'll be the guy to make the queen of the angels sigh? Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name Hello, I love you left me jump in your game Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name Hello, I love you left me jump in your game She holds her head so high like a statue in the sky Her arms are wicked and her legs are long When she moves my brain scream out their song Sidewalk crouches at her face like a dog that begs for something sweet Do you hope to make her see you both? Do you hope to block this dusky tour? Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello I want to know, I need my baby Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello Thank you. Thank you.
