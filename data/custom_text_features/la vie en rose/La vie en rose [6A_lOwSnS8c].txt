 The first part of the song is about the first part of the song. The first part of the song is about the first part of the song. The eyes that make my eyes drop A smile that falls on his mouth Here is the door and without a touch Of the man I belong to When he takes me in his arms And he talks to me all the time The rose life He tells me words of love Words of every day But I know something He is in my heart A great part of happiness That I know the cause He is for me, for him in life He tells me, he swears for life And as soon as I feel it So I will be my loved one who comes The enemy of love has finished A great part of happiness that takes its place Of the enemies of each face Happiness, happiness To smile When he takes me in his arms And he talks to me all the time I see the rose life He tells me words of love Words of every day But I know something He is in my heart A great part of happiness That I know the cause He is for me, for him in life He tells me words of love And as soon as I feel it So I will be my loved one who comes The enemy of love I'm a part of happiness That I know the cause I know the cause I know the cause And as soon as I feel it So I will be my loved one who comes To be my loved one who comes you Thank you.
