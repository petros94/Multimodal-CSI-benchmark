Des nuits d'amour à plus fin, Un grand honneur qui prend sa place, Des ennuis, des chagrins s'efface, Heureux, heureux, T'en mouris. Quand il me prend dans ses bras, Il me parle tout d'un, Revois la vie en haut. Il me dit des mots d'amour, Des mots de tous les jours, Et ça me fait quelque chose. Il est autrement mon coeur, Une part de bonheur, Donne-je connaître l'amour? C'est toi pour moi, moi pour toi, dans la vie, Tu me l'as dit, Ah, juré pour la vie! Dès que je t'aperçois, Alors je sors d'un mois, Mon coeur qui bat! Baa-baaa! Thank you.
