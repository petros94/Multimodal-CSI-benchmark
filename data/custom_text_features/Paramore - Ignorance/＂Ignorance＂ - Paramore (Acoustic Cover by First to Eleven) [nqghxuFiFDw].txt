 If I'm a bad person, you don't like me Well, guess I'll make my own way It's a circle, a mean cycle I can't excite you anymore Wish your gavel, your jury What's my offense this time? You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me We'll sentence me to another life Don't wanna hear your sad songs I don't wanna feel your pain Let me swear it's all my fault Cause you know we're not the same We're not the same Yeah, the friends are stuck together We're all in the dead blood But I guess you can't accept that The change is good It's good, it's good Will you treat me just like another stranger? Well, it's a nice, immediate start I guess I'll go, I'll best be on my way out Will you treat me just like another stranger? Well, it's a nice, immediate start I guess I'll go, I'll best be on my way out Ignorance is your new best friend Ignorance is your new best friend This is the best thing that could've happened Any longer than what animated It's not a war, I know it's not a rapture I'm just a person, but you can't take it The same tricks that, the ones for me They won't get you anywhere I'm not the same kid from your memory Well, now I can vent for myself Don't wanna hear your sad songs I don't wanna feel your pain Let me swear it's all my fault Cause you know we're not the same We're not the same Oh, we're not the same Yeah, we used to stick together We wrote our names in blood But I guess you can't accept that the change is good It's good, it's good Will you treat me just like another stranger? Well, it's a nice, immediate start I guess I'll go, I'll best be on my way out You'd treat me just like another stranger Well it's a lie, this won't lead you to her I guess I'll go a bit beyond my way Oh, ignorance is your new best friend Ignorance is your new best friend Ignorance is your new best friend Ignorance is your new best friend Music You'd treat me just like another stranger Well it's a lie, this won't lead you to her I guess I'll go a bit beyond my way You'd treat me just like another stranger Well it's a lie, this won't lead you to her I guess I'll go a bit beyond my way Hey guys thanks for watching our cover of Ignorance by Paramore.
