 If I'm a bad person, you don't like me, well I guess I'll make my own. It's a circle, I mean cycle, I can't excite you anymore. Where's your gavel, your jury? What's my offense this time? You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me, I'll sentence me to another life. Don't wanna hear your sad songs, I wanna feel your pain, but it's not my fault. You know we're not the same, we're not the same, oh I'm the same. Yeah, the friends are stuck together, if we're all in the same world, I guess you can accept that the change is good. It's good, it's good. Are you treating me just like another stranger? Well it's nice, I made you so, I guess I'll go, I must be on my way out. Ignorance is your new best friend, ignorance is your new best friend. This is the best thing that could've happened any longer, and I wouldn't have made it. It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture, I'm just a person, but you can't take it. The same tricks that they once fooled me, they won't get you anywhere. I'm not the same kid from your memory, well now I can fend for myself. Don't wanna hear your sad songs, I wanna feel your pain, but it's not my fault. You know we're not the same, we're not the same, oh we're not the same. Yeah, the friends are stuck together, if we're all in the same world, I guess you can accept that the change is good. It's good, it's good. Are you treating me just like another stranger? Well it's nice, I made you so, I guess I'll go, I must be on my way out. Ignorance is your new best friend, ignorance is your new best friend. Are you treating me just like another stranger? Well it's nice, I made you so, I guess I'll go, I must be on my way out. Out! Thank you.
