Ignorance is your new best friend, and this is the best thing that could have happened any longer and I wouldn't have made it. It's not a war, no it's not a rapture, I'm just a person but you can't take it. The same tricks that the ones fooled me, they won't get you anywhere. I'm not the same kid from your memory, well now I can fend for myself. Don't wanna hear your sad songs, I don't wanna feel your pain, we're just friends on my phone. Cause you know we're not the same, we're not the same, oh we're not the same. Yeah we used to stick together, we wrote our names in blood, but I guess you can't accept that the change is good. It's good, it's good. Well you treat me just like another stranger, well it's nice to meet you sir, I guess I'll go a best be on my way out.
