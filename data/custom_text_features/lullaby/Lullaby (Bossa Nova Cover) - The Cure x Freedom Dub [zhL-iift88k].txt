 I've got this ryplex, the Spider-Man comes Softly through the shadow of the Evening Sun Still in pairs, the windows of the place fully dead Looking for the victim shivering in bed Searching out of fear, in the gathering bin Suddenly a movement in the corner of the room There is nothing I can do, I won't realize with fright The Spider-Man is having me a full dinner tonight Quite the ill-lives, and shaking his head Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed And softer than the shadow when great curtain flies His songs are all around me and his song in my eyes Be some, they can't be quiet now, my precious sub-boy Don't struggle like that or I will in love with you more For it's much too late to get away, your turn on the light The Spider-Man is having me a full dinner tonight And I feel like I'm being eaten by a thousand million shivering furry holes And I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold And the Spider-Man is so sorry Spider-Man is so sorry Spider-Man is always over Ž Ž you
