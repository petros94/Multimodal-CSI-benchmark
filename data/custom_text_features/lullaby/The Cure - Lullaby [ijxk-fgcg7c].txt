 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I The spider man calm, so it's softly through the shadow of the evening sun Stealing in parts of windows of the place fully dead Looking for the fiction, shiver in her bed Searching out fear in the gathering of gloom Suddenly, I'm moving in the corner of the room and there is nothing to do When I realise you're flying in the spider man It's having me for dinner tonight Music Quietly lost, shaking his head Groups closer now, closer to the heart of the bed And softly in the shadow of hand, curvy thighs His arms around me and his tongue in my eyes Still can't recall it now, my precious boy Don't struggle like that, I will only move here But it's much too late to get away, turning on the light The spider man is having me for dinner tonight I feel like I'm being eaten by a thousand large and chewing furry holes I'm not done yet in the morning, I will wake up and shoot for you The spider man is always hungry Music Music I'm coming to my bottom, I set the spider to my bottom I left my little silver skin Music Music
