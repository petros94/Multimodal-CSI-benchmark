 Music City of stars, are you shining just for me? City of stars, there's so much that I can't see I feel so lonely, I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you That now our dreams may finally come true City of stars, just one thing everybody wants There in the bars, and through the smoke screen of the crowded restaurants It's love, yes all we're looking for is love from someone else A rush, a glance, a touch, a dance Looking somebody's eyes, to light up the skies To open the world and send it really A voice that says I'll be here and you'll be alright I don't care if I know, just where I will go Cause all that I need is that crazy feeling I've had time, time on my heart I think I want it to stay City of stars, are you shining just for me? City of stars, you never shined so brightly City of stars, you never shined so brightly
