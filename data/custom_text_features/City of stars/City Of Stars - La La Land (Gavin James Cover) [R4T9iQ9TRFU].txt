 Music playing. Sittin' stars, I ain't shining just for me. Sittin' stars, there's so much that I can't see. Well who knows, I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you. Well that now, our dreams, they finally come true. Sittin' stars, just one thing everybody wants. Well they're in the bars, and through the smoke screens of the crowded restaurants. Well it's a love, yes all we're looking for is a love from someone else. A rush, a glance, a touch, a dance. A look in somebody's eyes, to light up the skies, to open the world and set me reeling. A look that says I'll be here, and you'll be alright. Cause I don't care if I know, just where I will go. Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling, the right tight tight in my heart. I think I want it to stay. Sittin' stars, are you shining just for me? Sittin' stars, you've never shined so brightly.
