 A hundred days have made me older Since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lies have made me colder And I don't think I can look at this the same All the mouths that separate Disappear now and I'm dreaming of your face I'm here without you baby You're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby And I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight it's only you and me Mouth just keep rolling As the people leave their way to say hello I've heard this life is overrated But I hope that it gets better as we go I'm here without you baby You're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby And I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight boy it's only you and me Everything I know, anywhere I go It gets hard but it won't take away my love When the last one falls When it's all said and done It's hard but it won't take away my love I'm here without you baby You're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby And I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight boy it's only you and me Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Thank you for watching!
