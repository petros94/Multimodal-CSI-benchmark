 I'm gonna go to the next one. A hundred days that made me older Since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lies that made me colder And I don't think I can look at this the same But all these miles that separate They disappear now and I'm dreaming of your face I'm here without you baby, you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, you're still with me in my dreams And tonight it's only you and me, oh yeah And these miles just keep on going As the people lead their way to say hello Hello my friends I've heard this life is overrated But I know that it gets better as we go I'm here without you baby, you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, you're still with me in my dreams And tonight it's only you and me, everything I know And anywhere I go, if it's all I've been won't take away my love And when the last one falls, and then it's all set And then it's all been won't take away my love Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I'm here without you baby, you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, you're still with me in my dreams And tonight it's only you and me, yeah Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Thank you so much my friends Thank you.
