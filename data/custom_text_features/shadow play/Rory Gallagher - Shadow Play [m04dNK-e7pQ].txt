 The night starts to light, the shadows come, the moon waits to come and see tonight. I'm still not sure what part I play. Here's a shadow of flame, a shadow of flame. In the half-moon, it's midnight, I feel a voice inside. I don't know if I can see a half-moon in a storm's eyes, but I won't tell you how I can find my way. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame. Sounds compression, and I hear a little thing, all those lights just blaze away. I feel a little stretch inside, a little bit of trouble, a little mist behind. I don't know if I can see a half-moon in a storm's eyes, but I won't tell you how I can find my way. I don't know if I can see a half-moon in a storm's eyes, but I won't tell you how I can find my way. Sounds compression, and I hear a little thing, all those lights just blaze away. I feel a little stretch inside, a little mist behind. I've watched for a while, free as a child, into the night, across the screen, a thinnish blade, a magic light. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame. In the shadow of flame, shadow of flame.
