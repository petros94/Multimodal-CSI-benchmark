 I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom for me and you. And I think to myself what a wonderful world. I see skies of blue and clouds of white. The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night. And I think to myself what a wonderful world. The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky are also on the faces of people going by. I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do? They're really saying I love you. I hear papers cry, I watch them grow. They're much smoother than I never knew. And I think to myself what a wonderful world. Yes, I think to myself what a wonderful world. Oh, yes.
