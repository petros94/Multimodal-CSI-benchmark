 I see trees of grain, red roses too, I watch them bloom, from me and you, and I think to myself, what a wonderful world. I see skies of blue, clouds of white, the bright blessed day, and a dark sacred night, and I think to myself, what a wonderful world. The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky are also on the faces of the people passing by. I see friends she can handstand, how do you do? What parents say is I love you? I hear babies cry, I watch them grow, they'll learn much more than I'll ever know, and I think to myself, what a wonderful world. Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
