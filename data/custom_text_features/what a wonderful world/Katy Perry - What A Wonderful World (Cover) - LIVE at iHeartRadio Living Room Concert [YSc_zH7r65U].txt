 I see trees of green and roses too I see them bloom for me and you And I think to myself what a wonderful world I see skies of blue and grey clouds of white The bright, blessed days and the dark sacred nights And I think to myself what a wonderful world Oh yes it is the colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky Also on the faces of people going by I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do They're really saying oh I love you I hear babies cry I watch them grow They'll learn much more than I'll ever know And I think to myself what a wonderful world Oh yes I think to myself what a wonderful world you you
