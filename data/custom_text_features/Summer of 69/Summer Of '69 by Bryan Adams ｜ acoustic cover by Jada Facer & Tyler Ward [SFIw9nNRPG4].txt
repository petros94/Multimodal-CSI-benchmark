 I got my first real sick string, Bought it at the five and nine, Played it till my fingers Bled, was the summer of 69, Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard Jimmy Quinn, Charlie got married, Should've known we'd never get far But when I look back now, That summer seemed the last forever, And if I had the choice, Yeah, I'd always wanna be there Those were the best days of my life Back in the summer I ain't no use in complaining, When you got a job to do, I spend my evenings down at the driving And that's when I met you, yeah, Standing on your mama's porch, You told me that you'd wait forever Oh, and when you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never, Those were the best days of my life Oh yeah, back in the summer of 69, Oh yeah We were killing time, we were the only restless, We needed to unwind, I catch enough thinking lasts forever, forever And now the times are changing, To get everything that's coming gone, Sometimes when I play that old sick string, I think about you and what went wrong Standing on your mama's porch, You told me that it lasts forever, Oh, and when you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never, Those were the best days of my life Oh yeah, back in the summer of 69, Oh yeah Oh yeah
