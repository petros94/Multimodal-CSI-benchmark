 I got my first real sick string Bought it at the five and I played till my fingers blend It was the summer of 69 We earned some guys from school Had a band and we tried real hard Jimmy Grant, Jody Cotton, Marie I should've known we'd never get far Oh and I look back now The summer seemed to last forever And if I had a choice I'd always wanna be there Those were the best days of my life Ain't no use in complaining When you got a job to do Spent my evenings down after driving And that's where I met you Standing on your mama's porch You told me that you'd wait forever Oh when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never Those were the best days of my life Oh yeah Back in the summer of 69 Oh yeah And we were killing time We were young and restless We needed to unwind I guess nothing can last forever Forever now And now the times are changing Look at everything that's coming gone Sometimes when I play that old sick string I think about you when the water went wrong Standing on your mama's porch You told me it would last forever Oh the way you held my hand I knew that it was now or never Those were the best days of my life Oh yeah Back in the summer of 69 Oh yeah And now the times are changing Look at everything that's coming gone you
