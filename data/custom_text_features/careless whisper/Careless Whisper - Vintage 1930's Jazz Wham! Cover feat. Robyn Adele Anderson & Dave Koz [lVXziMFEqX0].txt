 I feel so unsure As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor As the music dies, something in your eyes Calls to mind, a silver screen and all it's said, goodbye So I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet of God, no rhythm, no it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should've known better than a cheetah friend No wasted chance that I have been given So I'm never gonna dance again the way I've danced with you Time can never mend The careless whispers of a good friend To the heart and mind Ignorance is kind There's no comfort in the truth Pain is so you'll find I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet of God, no rhythm, no it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should've known better than a cheetah friend No wasted chance that I have been given So I'm never gonna dance again the way I've danced with you So I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet of God, no rhythm, no it's easy to pretend Guilty feet of God, no rhythm, no it's easy to pretend Guilty feet of God, no rhythm, no it's easy to pretend The lights and music seem so loud I wish that we could lose the crowd Baby, it's better this way We heard each other with the things we wanna say We could've been so good together We could've lived this dance forever But now who's gonna dance with me? Please stay I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet of God, no rhythm, no it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should've known better than a cheetah friend No wasted chance that I have been given So I'm never gonna dance again the way I've danced with you So I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet of God, no rhythm, no it's easy to pretend You You You You Thank you. Thank you.
