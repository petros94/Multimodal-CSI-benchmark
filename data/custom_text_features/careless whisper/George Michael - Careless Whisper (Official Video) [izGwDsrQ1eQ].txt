 Oooooooh I feel so unsure As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor As the music dies, something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen, though it's a good one I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got the wrong rhythm But what's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool I should've known better to cheat and cry And waste the chance that I'd be given So I'm never gonna dance again, the way I dance with you Oooooooh Time can never mend The careless whispers are a good friend To the heart and mind I'm not a ignorant kind, there's no comfort in the truth Pain is the whole you find I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got the wrong rhythm But what's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool I should've known better to cheat and cry And waste the chance that I'd be given So I'm never gonna dance again, the way I dance with you Oooooooh Never with I had you I know Oooooooh Tonight the music sings so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say We could've been so good together We could've lived this dance forever But love was gonna dance with me Please stay And I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got the wrong rhythm But what's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool I should've known better to cheat and cry And waste the chance that I'd be given So I'm never gonna dance again, the way I dance with you Oooooooh Now that you're gone Now that you're gone It's so wrong, so wrong That you had to leave me alone But love But love But love But love But love But love But love But love But love Thanks for watching!
