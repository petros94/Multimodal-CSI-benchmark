 I found a love for me Darling just dive right in and follow my lead I found a girl she's beautiful and sweet I never knew you were that someone waiting for me Cause we were just kids when we fell in love not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time Darling just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own And in your eyes you're whole Denied baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass We're listening to our favorite song When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath You heard it Darling you look perfect tonight Yeah, well I found a man Stronger than anyone I know He shares my dreams I hope that someday we'll share a home Well I found a love To carry more than just my secrets To carry love To carry children of our own We are just kids but we're so in love Fighting against all odds I know we'll be alright this time Darling just hold my hand The organ will be my man I see my future in your eyes Baby, yeah, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass We're listening to our favorite song We're not so in that dress Looking so beautiful I don't need a servant I'm a user of perfect life I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass We're listening to our favorite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I am a, an angel in person If she loves her I know she's loving you You look perfect tonight I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thank you. Thank you.
