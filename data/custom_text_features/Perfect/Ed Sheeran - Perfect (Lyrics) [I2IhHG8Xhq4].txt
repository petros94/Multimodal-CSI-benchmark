 I found a love for me Darling just dive right in Follow my lead I found a girl Beautiful and sweet I never knew you were the someone Waiting for me Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time Darling just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own And in your eyes you're holding mine Baby I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath You heard it Darling you were perfect tonight Well I found a woman Stronger than anyone I know She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home I found a lover To carry more than just my secrets To carry love, to carry children of our own We are still kids but we're so in love Fighting against all odds We'll be alright this time Darling just hold my hand Be my girl, be your man I'll see the future in your eyes Baby I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that dress Looking so beautiful I don't deserve this Darling you look perfect tonight Darling Baby I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met an angel In person and she looks perfect I don't deserve this You look perfect tonight You look perfect tonight You look perfect tonight You look perfect tonight You look perfect tonight You look perfect tonight You look perfect tonight Thanks for watching!
