 Here comes the sun, do do do do, here comes the sun, I say, it's alright. Little darling, it's been a long cold, lonely winter. Little darling, it feels like it's since it's been here. Here comes the sun, do do do do, here comes the sun, I say, it's alright. Little darling, the smile's returning to the faces. Little darling, it seems like it's since it's been here. Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, I say, it's alright. Sun, sun, sun, here it comes. Little darling, I feel that I see it slowly melting. Little darling, it seems like it's since it's been here. Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, I say, it's alright. Here comes the sun, do do do, here comes the sun, it's alright. It's alright. Thank you for watching!
