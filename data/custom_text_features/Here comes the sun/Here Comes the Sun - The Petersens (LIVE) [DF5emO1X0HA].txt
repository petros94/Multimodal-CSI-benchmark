 Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's alright. Little darling, it's been a long, long, lonely winter. Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here. Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's alright. Little darling, this mouth's returned to their faces. Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here. Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's alright. Sun, sun, sun, here it comes, sun, sun, sun, here it comes. Little darling, I feel that I see slowly energy. Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here. Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's alright. Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's alright. It's alright. Thank you for watching!
