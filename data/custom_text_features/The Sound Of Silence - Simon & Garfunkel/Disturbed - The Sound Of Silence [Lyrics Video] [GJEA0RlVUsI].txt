 And I'm darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because the vision softly agree being Left its scenes while I was living And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone And narrow streets of cobblestone With a halo of a streamland I turned my color to the cold and damp When my eyes were stand by the flash of a neon light That split my neck and touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw 10,000 people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never shed And no one dared to stir the sound of silence Fools said, I do not know, silence like a cancer grows Hear my words and I'm a hide and seek you Take my arms and I'm a hide and seek you And my words like silent raindrops fell Can get cold in the words of silence And the people bowing in the rain To the neon god of the evening In the sign flashed out in his morning Hear the words that it will hers for me In the sign said the words of the prophet It's written on the sign where he was In tenement halls with a smile on the sign of silence In the sign said the words of the prophet It's written on the sign where he was In the sign said the words of the prophet
