 Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because of vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the sound of silence In restless streams I walked alone Narrow the streets of cobblestone Beneath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no wonder they stir the sound of silence Full said I you do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might read you But my words like silent range of fail And echoed in the walls of silence And the people bound in red To the neon god that I met In the slimes of shining and falling And the words that you were asked for me And the signs and the words of the prophets are anonymous of wayward And entitlement holds And whispered in the sound of silence Hey!
