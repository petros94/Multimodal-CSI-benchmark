 I can't seem to face up to the facts, Tents and nerves, I can't relax, I can't sleep, my bed's on fire, Don't touch me, I'm a real life wild, Psycho killer, kiss-kissing, Better run run run, run run away, Psycho killer, kiss-kissing, Better run run run, run run away, Oh, ay, ay, ay, ay, You start a conversation, you can't even finish, You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything, When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed, Say something once, why say it again? Psycho killer, kiss-kissing, Better run run run, run run away, Oh, Psycho killer, kiss-kissing, Better run run run, run run away, Oh, ay, ay, ay, ay, You start a conversation, you can't even finish, You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything, You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything, When I have anything to say, my lips are sealed, Run run run, run run away, Psycho killer, kiss-kissing, Better run run run, run run away, Oh, ay, ay, ay, ay, You start a conversation, you can't even finish, You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything,
