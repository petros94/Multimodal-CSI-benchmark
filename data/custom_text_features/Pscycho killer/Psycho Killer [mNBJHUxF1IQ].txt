 Psyche, go kill her, can't squeeze it. Run, run, run away, oh, psycho killer. Can't seem to face up to the facts. I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax. Can't sleep, cause my bed's on fire. Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire. Psyche, go kill her, just can't say. Run, run, run away, oh, psycho killer. You start a conversation, you can't even finish it. You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything. When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed. Say something once, why say it again? Psycho killer, guess who's saying? Psyche, go kill her, just can't say. Psyche, go kill her, guess who's saying? Psyche, go kill her, just can't say. Psyche, go kill her, just can't say. So, can I be, just one love? Psycho killer, guess who's saying? So, good job, babe, just one love? Psycho killer, guess who's saying? So, can I be, just one love?
