 Right or wrong. To dream the impossible dream. To fight the unbeatable phone. To bear with unbearable sorrow. To run where the brave dare not go. To write the unrightable wrong. To love pure and chaste from afar. To try when your arms are too weary. To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest to follow the star. No matter how hopeless. No matter how far. To fight for the right. Without question or pause. To be willing to pass into hell. For a heavenly cause. And I know if I'll only be true. To the glorious quest. That my heart lies peaceful and calm. When I'm laid to my rest. And the world will be better for me. That one man scorned and covered with scars. Still strong with his lost ounce of courage. To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest to follow the star. No matter how hopeless. No matter how far. To fight for the right. Without question or pause. And to dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. The impossible dream. you you
