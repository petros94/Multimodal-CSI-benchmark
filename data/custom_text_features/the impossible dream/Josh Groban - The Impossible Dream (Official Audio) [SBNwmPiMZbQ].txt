 To dream the impossible dream. To fight the unbeatable foe. To bear with unbearable sorrow. And to run where the brave dare not go. To write the unrightable wrong. And to love pure and chaste from afar. To try when your arms are too weary. To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest to follow that star. No matter how hopeless. No matter how far. To fight for the right. Without question or parts. To be willing to march, march into hell. For that heavenly cause. And I know if I'll only be true. To this glorious quest. Let my heart rely peaceful and calm. When I lay to my rest. And the world will be better for this. Than one man scorned and covered with scars. Still strong with his last ounce of courage. To reach the unreachable, the unreachable, the unreachable star. I'll always dream the impossible dream. Yes, then I'll reach the unreachable star. I'll reach the unreachable star. I'll reach the unreachable star. Thank you. Thank you.
