 Can anybody find me? Somebody to love. Each morning I get out of my dial, Can barely stand on my feet. Take a look, take a look, In the mirror I cry, I heard what you gave me, I asked the man of my years to believe in you, But I just can't get a relief. Somebody to somebody, Can anybody find me? Can anybody to love? I work hard, Every day of my life, I worked like my bones, At the end of the day, I take home my heart and say, All of the orders I got out, These plans are low, To let tears run down from my eyes. Somebody, Can anybody find me? Can anybody to love? Every day, I try, I try, I try, Everybody wants to put me down, They say I'm gone crazy, They try to allow me to read my praise, I got the concept, He's got nobody there to believe. Can anybody find me? Can anybody, Can anybody find me? I got no rhythm, I just keep losing my beat, I'm losing my ride, He's alright, he's alright, He's not ready, I just gotta get out of this prison cell, To one day, I'm gonna be free. Find me, somebody to love. Find me, somebody to love. Find me, somebody to love. Find me, somebody to love. Find me, somebody to love.
