 Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's go. Music plays. Each morning I get up, I try and look. Can't really still feel. Take a look in the mirror and cry. Lord, what you're doing to me. I've spent all my years in believing you, but I just can't get no relief. Lord, somebody's over me. Somebody's over me. Can anybody find me? Somebody's over me. Yeah. I work hard every day of my life. I work till I can my bones at the end. I take on my heart and pay all of my own. I go down to my knees and I start to breathe till the tears run down from my eyes. Lord, somebody's over me. Somebody's over me. Can anybody find me? Somebody's over me. Help me. I try and I try and I try, but everybody wants to help me die. They say I've gone crazy. They say I don't want to be that brave. I've got no common sense. Got nobody left to believe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody, somebody's over me. Can anybody find me? Somebody's over me. Everybody's over me. Somebody's over me. I've got no fear. I've got no rhythm. I just keep losing my beat. But I'm okay. I'm alright. I ain't gonna face none of it. I just gotta get out of this prison cell. Someday I'm gonna be free long. Find me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love. Find me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love. Can anybody find me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love. Can anybody find me, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love, find Me somebody to love. Thank you for watching!
