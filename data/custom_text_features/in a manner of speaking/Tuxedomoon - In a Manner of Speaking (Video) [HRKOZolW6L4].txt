In a manner of speaking, I don't understand how loving silence becomes reprimand, but the way that I feel about you is beyond words. Oh, give me the words, give me the words that tell me nothing. Oh, give me the words, give me the words that tell me everything.

So in a manner of speaking, I just want to say that like you, I should find a way to tell you everything by saying nothing. Oh, give me the words, give me the words that tell me nothing. Oh, give me the words, give me the words that tell me nothing. Oh, give me the words, give me the words, give me the words. you you
