 Kicking with my woman cause she, cause she helps me with my mouth People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy I think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify Can you hurt me? Are you for my brain? Oh yeah Make a joke and I will sigh You will laugh and I will cry The happiness I cannot feel The love to me is so unreal And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late Can you hurt me? Are you for my brain? Oh yeah Can you hurt me? Are you for my brain? Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah
