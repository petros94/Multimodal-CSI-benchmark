 You You You People think I'm insane because I am frowning over time. All day long I think of things but when nothing seems to satisfy, they gotta lose my mind if I don't find something to fight. Can you help me? I'll do for my brain. Oh yeah. I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find. I can't see the things that make true happiness, I'm a big liar. I can't see the things that make true happiness, I'm a big liar. I can't see the things that make true happiness, I'm a big liar. I can't see the things that make true happiness, I'm a big liar. Making jokes and I will sign you a love and I will cry. Happiness I cannot feel like love to me is so unreal. It's the way to hear these words telling you now, all my mistakes. I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could burn too late. I can't see the things that make true happiness, I'm a big liar. you Thank you.
