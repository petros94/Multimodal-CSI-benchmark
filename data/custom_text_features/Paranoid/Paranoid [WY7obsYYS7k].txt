 The End. The End. All day long I think of things, one I think seems too satisfied. Think I lose my mind if I don't fasten things too fast and buy. Can you help me? I use my brain. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I ain't somewhat do so many of the things in life that I can't find. I can't see the things that make true happiness. I must be blind. The End. Make a joke and I will fly and you will laugh and I will cry. I think it's hard to care not feel so lucky to me. It's so unreal. The End. Why should you hear these words that lead you now? Oh, I'm a bastard. I can't do the winter life. I wish I could try this too late. Nick, Nick, Nick! Fuck me running.
