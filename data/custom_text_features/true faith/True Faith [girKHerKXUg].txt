 I feel so extraordinary. Something's gotta hold on me. And get this feeling of emotion. Sudden sense of liberty. I don't care cause I'm not there. And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow again and again. I've taken too much of the things that cost you too much. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see the light and the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is a drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. And my life would depend on the morning sun. But the day would never come. When I was a very small girl, very small girl, I'll stop to me. Now that we've grown up together, they're afraid of what they see. That's a price that we all pay. The value of destiny comes to nothing. I can't tell you where we're going. I guess there's just no way of knowing. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see the light and the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is a drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun. That the day would never come. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I feel so extraordinary. Something's gotta hold on me. Again, this feeling of emotion, a sudden case of liberty. The chances are we've gone too far. You took my time and you took my money. And now I fear you've left me standing in a world that's so demanding. I'm sorry.
