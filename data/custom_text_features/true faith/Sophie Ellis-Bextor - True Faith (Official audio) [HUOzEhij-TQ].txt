I feel so extraordinary, some things gotta hold on me I get this feeling I'm in motion, sudden sense of liberty I don't care cause I'm not there And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow Again and again I've taken too much of the things that cost you too much I used to think that the day would never come I see delight in the shade of the morning sun The morning sun is the drug that brings me near To the child I lost, replaced by fear I used to think that the day would never come That my life would depend on the morning sun Music playing. When I was a very small girl Very small girls talked to me Now that we've grown up together Yeah I'm afraid on what they see That's the price that we all pay Our value of destiny comes to nothing I can't tell you where we're going I guess there's just no way of knowing I used to think that the day would never come I see delight in the shade of the morning sun The morning sun is the drug that brings me near To the child that I lost, replaced by fear I used to think that the day would never come That my life would depend on the morning sun Music playing. Music playing. I feel so extraordinary So things gotta hold on me I get this feeling I'm in motion A sudden sense of liberty The chances are we've gone too far You took my time and you took my money Now I feel you left me standing In a world that's so demanding I used to think that the day would never come I see delight in the shade of the morning sun The morning sun is the drug that brings me near To the child that I lost, replaced by fear I used to think that the day would never come That my life would depend on the morning sun Music playing.
