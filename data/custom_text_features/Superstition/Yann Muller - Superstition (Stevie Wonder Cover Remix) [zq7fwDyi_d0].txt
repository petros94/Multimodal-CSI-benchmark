 The End. Music. Every superstitious letter's about to fall. Thirteen month old baby broke the looking glass. Seven years of anger, the good things in the past. Then you believe in things that you don't understand. Then you suffer superstition in the way. Yeah. Every superstitious wash your face and hair. Be a problem, do all that you can. Keep me in a daydream, keep me going strong. You don't wanna save me, sad is my song. You believe in things that you don't understand. Then you suffer superstition in the way. Music. Every superstitious, nothing more to say. Every superstitious, the devil's on his way. Thirteen month old baby broke the looking glass. Seven years of bad luck, the good things in the past. Then you believe in things, you believe in things, you believe in things, you believe in things. Then you suffer superstition in the way. Music.
