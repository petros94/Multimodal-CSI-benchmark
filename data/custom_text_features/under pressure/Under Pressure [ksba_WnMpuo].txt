 Music playing. Music playing. Pressure, pushing down on me, pressing down on you, no matter how smooth. What's the pressure that blows a building down, splits a family into, puts people on streets. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Why can't we give them, give them, give them, give them, give them, give them, give them, give them. Music playing. This is our last dance, this is ourselves, under pressure. Music playing.
