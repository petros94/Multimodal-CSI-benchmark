 Come all you good workers, good news to you, I'll tell you how the good old union has come in here to dwell Which set are you on boys? Which set are you on? And there he was a minor, he's now in the heaven's sun We will give our workers until the battle's won Which set are you on boys? Which set are you on? They say in Holland County that I know new girls there Hear me, a union man who fell the church prayer Which set are you on boys? Which set are you on? We will give our workers until the battle's won Will workers, can you stand it? Well tell me how you can, will you be a lousy scabble, will you be a man? Which set are you on boys? Which set are you on? Don't scare for the bosses, don't listen till they lies Poor folks ain't got a chance unless they organize Which set are you on boys? Which set are you on? Which set are you on boys? Which set are you on? Which set are you on boys? Which set are you on? Which set are you on?
