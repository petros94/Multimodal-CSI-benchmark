 but one more American guest. First, let's see the European continent. And for my little bit in English, this is one of my very, very favorite stars. He's a wonderful man. Here to sing his new one, it's called Something's Gotta Hold My Heart, Mr. Jean Pitney. Something's gotta hold my heart, keeping my soul and my senses apart. Something's gotta into my life, cutting its way through my dreams like a knife. Turning me up, turning me down, making me smile, and making me frown, in a world that was small. I once lived in a time that was peace with no trouble at all. But then you came my way, and a feeling unknown broke my heart, made me want you to stay, all of my nights, and all of my days. Yeah, I gotta tell you now, something's gotten over my head, breaking my soul to a beautiful end. Now, something has indeed in my mind, painted my sleep with the colors so bright, changing the gray, changing the blue, scarlet for me, and scarlet for you. I've got to know if this is the real thing. I've got to know what's making my heart sing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You smile and I am lost for a lifetime. Each minute spent with you is the right time. Every hour, every day, yeah. I've got to know if this is the real thing. And baby, and baby, something's got over my head, breaking my soul to a beautiful end. Yeah, something has invaded my night. Thank you, my sweet, my sweet, my sweet, my sweet.
