 Something's got a hold of my heart Keeping my soul and my senses apart Something's gotten into my life Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife Turning me, turning me down Laking me smile, making me proud In a world that was small I once lived in a time that was peace with no trouble at all But then you came my way And I'm feeling a noise So my heart made me want you to stay All of my nights and all of my days I wanted to know something's gotten with the man Dragging my soul to a beautiful land Something hasn't faded my night Changing my sleep with the color so bright Changing the perfect day Changing the blue Scarlet for me, scarlet for you I've got to know if this is the real thing I've got to know what's making my heart say oh oh oh oh oh yeah Smile and I am lost for a lifetime Each man spent with you is the right time Every hour, yeah, every day, yeah It's honey and my mind goes astray, yeah And baby, yeah, and baby, yeah Something's gotten hold of my hand Dragging my soul to a beautiful land Yeah, something's gotten into my life Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife Turning me up, turning down, making me smile Making me cry In a world that was war, our ones lived in a time that was peace with no trouble at all But then you, you, you, you came my way And a feeling unknown, so my heart made me want you to stay On my nights and all of my days Something's gotten hold of my hand Keeping my soul and my senses alive Yeah, something has evaded my night Hanging my sleep with the colors so bright and changing the gray, changing the blue The room is scarlet for me and scarlet for me Thank you for watching! Thank you.
