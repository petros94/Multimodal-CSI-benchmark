 Night in white satin, never reaching the end Letter written, never meaning to send Beauty I always missed, with eyes before Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore Cause I love you, yeah I love you, oh I love you Gazing at people, cause I'm hand in hand Just what I'm going through, they can't understand Some tried to tell me, thought they can't ever defend Just what you want to be, you will be in the end And I love you, yeah I love you, oh I love you Gazing at people, cause I'm hand in hand Night in white satin, never reaching the end Letter, I've written, never meaning to send Beauty I always missed, with eyes before Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore Cause I love you, yeah I love you, oh I love you Cause I love you, yeah I love you, oh I love you I love you, I love you
