 Music Nights in white satin Never quite reaching the end I've got the letters here I've written I never meant to send Beauty I've always missed With these old eyes before Just what the truth is I can't say no more But I love you I love you I love you I love you Gazing at people Some of them walk in their hand and hand Exactly what I'm going through I don't think they can understand Some of them try to tell me Thoughts they can't even defend Whatever it is you want to pay You're gonna be in the end But I just wanna say I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you Oh, oh, oh Oh, I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you you
