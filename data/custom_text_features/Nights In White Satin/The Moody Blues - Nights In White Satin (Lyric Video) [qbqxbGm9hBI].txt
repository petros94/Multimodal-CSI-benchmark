 Night's in white satin Never reaching the end Letters I've written Never meaning to send Beauty I'd always missed With these eyes before Just what the truth is I can't say anymore Cause I love you, yes I love you, I love you Gazing at people Some hand in hand Just what I'm going through They can't understand Some try to tell me Thoughts they cannot defend Just what you want to be You'll be in the end And I love you, yes I love you, I love you Oh Oooooooo Ooooooooooo What can we do? Nights in wide-sighted blue, never reaching the end, letters I would remove, never meaning to send, beauty I've always missed, with his eyes before, just one true thing, I can't say anymore, because I love you, because I love you, I love you, because I love you, because I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, Thank you.
