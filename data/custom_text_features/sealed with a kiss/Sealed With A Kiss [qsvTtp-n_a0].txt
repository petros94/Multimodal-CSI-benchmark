 Though we gotta say goodbye for the summer, darling I promise you this, I'll send you all my love every day in a letter, sealed with a kiss, guess it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer, but I'll feel the emptiness, I'll send you all my dreams every day in a letter, sealed with a kiss, I'll see you in the sunlight, I'll hear your voice everywhere, I'll run to tenderly hold you, but darling you won't be there, I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer, not only the loveliness, oh let us make a pledge to meet in September, and seal it with a kiss. Yes it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer, but I'll feel the emptiness, I'll send you all my love every day in a letter, sealed with a kiss, sealed with a kiss, sealed with a kiss. you Thank you.
