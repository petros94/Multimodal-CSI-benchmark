 I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Oh, we've got a single fine for the summer. Darling, I promise you this. I'll send you all my love. Every day in the letter. See you when the case is going to be a cold. Loneless summer. But I'll feel the emptiness. I'll send you all my dreams. Every day in the letter. See you when the case. I'll see you in the sunlight. I'll hear your voice everywhere. I'll run to tenderly hold you. But darling, you won't be there. I don't want to say goodbye for the summer. Knowing the love for this, oh, let us make a pledge to meet in September. And see you when the case. Yes, it's going to be a cold, lonely summer. But I'll feel the emptiness. I'll send you all my love. Every day in the letter. See you when the case. See you when the case. See you when the case. you you
