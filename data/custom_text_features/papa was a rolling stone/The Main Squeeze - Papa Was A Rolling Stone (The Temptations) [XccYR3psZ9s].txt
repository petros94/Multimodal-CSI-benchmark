I never got a chance to meet him. Never heard nothing but bad things about him. Mama, I'm dependent on you to tell me the truth. Mama just hung her head and she said Papa was a rolling stone. Wherever he laid his hat was his home. And when he died, oh he left, was his home. My mama told me Papa was a rolling stone. Wherever he laid his hat was his home. When he died, oh he left, was his home. Yeah. Yeah. Hey mama, is it true what they say? That Papa never worked a minute our day in his life. Mama, I heard bad talk going around town. Papa had three outside children and another wife. That ain't right. Heard some talking about Papa doing some stuff for a preaching. Talking about saving souls and all the time leaching. Dealing and dying, stealing in the name of the Lord. Mama just hung her head and she said Papa was a rolling stone. Wherever he laid his hat was his home. And when he died, oh he left, was his home.
