 All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces Frightened to live for their daily races, going nowhere, going nowhere Their tears are filling up their glasses, no expression, no expression At my head I want to tell myself, you're tomorrow, you're tomorrow And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take When people are all in circles, it's a very bad mad world Children waiting for the day they feel good, happy birthday, happy birthday It's a feeling where the children sit and listen, sit and listen It's a school now, it's very nervous, no one knew me, no one knew me And I'll teach you, tell you what's my lesson, you cry through me, you cry through me And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take When people are all in circles, it's a very, very bad world Bad world Bad world And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take When people are all in circles, it's a very bad Bad world The world you want, bad world The world you want, bad world The world you want, bad world
