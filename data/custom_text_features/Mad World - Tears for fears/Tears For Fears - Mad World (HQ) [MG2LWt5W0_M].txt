 All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces Frightened and lit for the daily races, going nowhere, going nowhere There tears are filling up their glosses, no expression, no expression At my head I want to tell myself, you're tomorrow, you're tomorrow Then I find a kind of funny, I find a kind of sad All dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take I want people right in front of me, it's a very bad, bad world Children waiting for the day they feel good, happy birthday, happy birthday They're too filled with the tech which I should sit and listen, sit and listen It's a school and I was very nervous, no one knew me, no one knew me I will teach you to know what's my lesson, you cried through me, you cried through me Then I find a kind of funny, I find a kind of sad All dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take When people right in front of me, it's a very, very bad world Bad world Then I find a kind of funny, I find a kind of sad All dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take When people right in front of me, it's a very bad, bad world The world you know is bad world The world you know is bad world The world you know is bad world
