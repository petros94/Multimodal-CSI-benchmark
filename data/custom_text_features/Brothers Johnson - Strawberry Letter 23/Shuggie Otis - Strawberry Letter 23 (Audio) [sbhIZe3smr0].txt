 Hello my love, I heard gifts from you Red magic satin playing in tune All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine Rainbows and water fall from through my mind In the garden I see was purple shower bells and tea Orange birds and river cousins just in me Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud Blue fireworks that go from a cherry cloud Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue Playgrounds will laugh if you try to ask Is it cool? If you will ride and don't see me I'm going to be with my baby I am free Fly in our arms over the sea Same window yellow candy screen six fingers up high With velvet roses digging freedom fly A present from you strawberry ledge went to The music plays I sing for you Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Music plays Music plays Music plays Music plays Music plays Thank you. Thank you.
