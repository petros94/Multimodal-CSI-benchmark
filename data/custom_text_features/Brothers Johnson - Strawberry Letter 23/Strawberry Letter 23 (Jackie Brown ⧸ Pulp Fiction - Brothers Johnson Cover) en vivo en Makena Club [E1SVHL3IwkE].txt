 Hello my love, I heard a kiss from you A magic sign that you knew, do you? All through the morning rain again, the sun doesn't shine Rainbows and wet effects run through my mind In the garden I see, whispered the shower bells and teardrops Orange birds and red wood cousins, resting real When the music I hear, so happy and loud Blue flowers second from a jerry cloud The sun shines far, the pink and blue playgrounds with love If you try to ask, is it cool? Is it cool? If you arrive and don't see me, I'm gonna be here with my baby I am free, flying her arms over the sea St. Louis yellow canvas green, so pink as a kite With velvet roses, begin frivin' fine A present from you, it's your buried letter, tried you To the music plays I sit in far of you Music plays Music plays Music plays A present from you, it's your buried letter, tried you To the music plays I sit in far of you Music plays Music plays
