 Hello my love, I heard a kiss from you Red magic satin clay in here too All through the morning rain I gave The sun does it shine Rain falls and water falls run through my mind In the garden I see West purple shower bells Fondant birds and river cubs Interesting rain Pretty music out here So happy to laugh Blue flowers echo from my cherry cloud Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue A playgrounds full of laughs If you try to ask Is it cool? Is it cool? If you arrive and don't see me I'm gonna be with my baby I'm free, fly through all over the sea Staying with no yellow candy strings See speakers of kites With velvet roses taking freedom flight A present from you Strawberry letter trying to chip The music plays a setting ball Ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh A present from you Strawberry letter trying to chip The music plays a setting ball Ooh ooh ooh ooh
