 Hello my love, I heard a kiss from you Red magic sight and play in it too All through the morning rain I gaze The sun doesn't shine Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind In the garden I see West purple shower bells and tea Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green Pretty music I hate So happy and loud Blue flower echo from a cherry cloud Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue Playgrounds will laugh if you try to ask Is it cool? If you arrive and don't see me I'm gonna be with my baby I'm free Flying in her arms over the sea Staying in the yellow candy screen See speakers of kind With all the roses digging freedom fight A present from you Strawberry, weather 22 The music plays I sit for a few Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da la la la la la... la la la la la... la la la la la... la la la la la... la la la la la... la la la la la...
