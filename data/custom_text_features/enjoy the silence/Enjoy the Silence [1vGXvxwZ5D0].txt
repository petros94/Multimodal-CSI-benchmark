 you you you you you you words like violence break the silence come crashing in into my little world painful to me pierce right through me can't you understand all my little girls all I ever wanted all I ever needed is here in my arms words are very unnecessary that you can only do you fousers spoken to be broken feelings are intense words are trivial pleasures remain so does the pain words are meaningless and forgettable all I ever wanted all I ever needed is here in my arms words are very unnecessary that you can only do you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you words are very unnecessary that you can only do you you No silence. Thank you.
