 Music playing. Music playing. With black flowers break the silence Come crashing in into my little world Painful to me, feels right through me Can you understand? Oh my little girl All of the water and all I ever needed Is here in my heart Words are very unnecessary They can only do one Music playing. Thousands spoken, to be broken Feelings aren't it, words are trivial Pleasures remain, photos of pain Words are meaningless And think of hope All of the water and all I ever needed Is here in my heart Words are very unnecessary They can only do one All of the water and all I ever needed Is here in my heart Words are very unnecessary They can only do one Music playing. All of the water and all I ever needed Is here in my heart Words are very unnecessary They can only do one All of the water and all I ever needed Is here in my heart Words are very unnecessary They can only do one Music playing. Music playing. Thank you. Thank you.
