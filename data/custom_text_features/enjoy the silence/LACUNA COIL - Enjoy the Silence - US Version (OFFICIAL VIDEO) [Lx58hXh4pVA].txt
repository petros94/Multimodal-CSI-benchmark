 you you you hearts like violence break the silence don't crash me into my little world painful to me, there's right through me can't you understand, oh my little girl I wanted, but I needed it here in my arms words are very unnecessary, they can only do more thousands spoken to be broken, feelings are tense words are trivial, flashes remain so the scuff paint words are meaningless and forgettable I wanted, but I needed it here in my arms words are very unnecessary, they can only do more I wanted, but I needed it here in my arms words are very unnecessary, they can only do more I wanted, but I needed it here in my arms words are very unnecessary, they can only do more enjoy the silence enjoy the silence you you
