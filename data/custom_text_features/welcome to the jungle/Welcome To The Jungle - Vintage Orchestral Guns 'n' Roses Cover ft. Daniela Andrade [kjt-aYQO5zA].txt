 Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games, we've got everything you want. Honey we know the names, we are the people I can find, whatever you may need. If you've got no money, honey, we've got your disease in the jungle. Welcome to the jungle, why'd you bring it to your knees? Welcome to the jungle, you take it day by day. If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay and you're up. Very sexy girl, very hearty please, you can taste the bright lights, but you won't get everything in the jungle. Welcome to the jungle, I wanna watch you leave. Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse every day. You'll learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play. You gotta hunger for what you see, you take it eventually. You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me in the jungle. Welcome to the jungle, I wanna hear you scream. Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, I wanna watch you leave. And when you're high, you never, ever wanna come down. And when you're high, you never, ever wanna come down. Down, down, down, down, yeah, yeah, yeah. Woo. Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle. Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, I wanna watch you scream. Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, I wanna watch you leave. Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, I wanna watch you leave. Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, I wanna watch you leave.
