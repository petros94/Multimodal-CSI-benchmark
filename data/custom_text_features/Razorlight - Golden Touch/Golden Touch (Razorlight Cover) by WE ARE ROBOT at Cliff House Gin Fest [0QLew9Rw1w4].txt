 I'm no girl with a golden touch She's got no, she's got too much But I know she wouldn't mind You could never have it all if you wanted You could never have it all if it mattered so much But then all the dark starts to put you down When you're dead, we are friends, oh But when you're not around, I said oh, she's changed But you know what that means, what it means They're just jealous cause they'll never do the things that they wish they could do so well I'm a girl you should never know Keep a thousand messages on my phone But you know you'll never get through You could never have it all if you wanted You could never have it all if it mattered so much But then all the dark starts to put you down When you're dead, we are friends, oh But when you're not around, I said oh, she's changed But you know what that means, what it means They're just jealous cause they'll never do the things that they wish they could do so well I'm a girl you should never know Keep a thousand messages on my phone I'm a girl you should never know Keep a thousand messages on my phone Just get a listen to the words of fools But don't give away too much Someone will need your cold touch Cause all the dark starts to put you down When you're dead, we are friends, oh But when you're not around, I said oh, she's changed But you know what that means, what it means They're just jealous cause they'll never do the things that they wish they could do so well Cause all the dark starts to put you down When you're dead, we are friends, oh But when you're not around, I said oh, she's changed But you know what that means, what it means They're just jealous cause they'll never do the things that they wish they could do so well They'll never do the things that they wish they could do so well Thanks for you very much
