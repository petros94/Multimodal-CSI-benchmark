 Oh, baby love, my baby love, I need you, oh, oh, I need you. But all you do is treat me bad, break my heart and leave me sad. Tell me what did I do wrong to make you stay away so long? Cause baby love, my baby love, been missing you, mischievous, instead of breaking up, there's nothing kissing and making up. Don't throw our love away in my arms, don't you stay, need you, need you, baby love, whoo, baby love. Baby love, my baby love, why must you separate my love? All of my whole life through, I never loved no one but you. Why you do me like you do? I get this need. Oh, baby love, need to hold you, once again my love, feel your warmth embrace my love. Don't throw our love away, please come to me this way. Now I've had what I used to be, loneliness and that's the best of me, my love, my baby love, I need you, oh, oh, I don't need you. Why you do me like you do? I fly into the air, so deep in love with you. Baby, baby, baby, ooh, tell it's hate me, tell it's hate me, ooh, baby love. Don't throw our love away. you Thank you.
