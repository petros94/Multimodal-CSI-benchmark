 Music playing. Music playing. So close no matter how far Couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are And nothing else matters Music playing. Never open myself this way Life is ours, we live it our way All these words I don't just say Nothing else matters Trust I sink and I find in you Every day for something new Open mind for a different view And nothing else matters Music playing. Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know I know So close no matter how far Couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are And nothing else matters Music playing. Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know I know I know Never open myself this way Life is ours, we live it our way All these words I don't just say Nothing else matters Trust I sink and I find in you Every day for something new Open mind for a different view And nothing else matters Never cared for what they see Never cared for games they play Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know I know I know Music playing. So close no matter how far Couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are Now nothing else matters Music playing.
