 It's been seven hours and fifty days Since you took your love away I go out every night and sleep all day Since you took your love away Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want I can see whoever I choose I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant But nothing, I said nothing can take away this blues Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you It's been so lonely without you here Like a bird without a song Nothing can stop these loneliness from falling Tell me baby, when did I go wrong? I put my arm around every boy I see They don't leave me behind again I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me You said girl you better try to help or no matter what you do But here's a fool, cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you You said girl you better try to help or no matter what you do Oh oh oh oh oh All the flowers that you planted mama in the backyard, all died in a windmill I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard But I'm willing to give it another try Nothing compares, nothing compares to you Nothing compares, nothing compares to you You said girl you better try to help or no matter what you do Thank you.
