 Music playing. Music playing. It's been 7,015 days since you took your long way. I go out all night and sleep all day since you took your long way. Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want. I can see whoever I choose. I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant. Nothing, nothing can take away this blue. There's nothing compared, nothing compared to you. It's been so lonely without you here. Like a bird without a song. Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling. I can't tell me where did I go wrong. I can put my arms around that little girl I choose. But it just reminds me of you. I went to the doctor and guess what he told me. He said boy you better try to have fun no matter what you do. But he's a fool cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. Cute and Simon's. Music playing. Music playing. All the flowers that you planted mama. In your backyard. You all died when you went away. And I know living with me baby is sometimes hard. But I'm willing to give it another try. There's nothing compared, nothing compares to you. Nothing compares, nothing compares to you. Thank you.
