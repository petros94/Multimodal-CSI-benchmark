 You and I, bloodlines, we come together every time Two arms for eyes, we lose ourselves at night From the outside, from the outside Everyone must be one dream, why we try Why do we try? Baby and I while this moment, we could be the greatest Baby and I while this moment, we could be the worst of all Baby and I while this moment, we could be the greatest Baby and I while this moment, we could be the worst of all Ooh, ooh, ooh Weight up from the sky, wherever the smoke, there's no need to be fired Ooh, I could bring bad luck, I've been looking at you too much From the outside, from the outside Everyone must be one dream, why we try Why do we try? Baby and I while this moment, we could be the greatest Baby and I while this moment, we could be the worst of all Baby and I while this moment, we could be the greatest Baby and I while this moment, we could be the worst of all In the middle of it all, we walk, we walk the line Looking back on the scene, our wildest moments Are you thinking what if, what if we ruined it all My wrecking ball From the outside, from the outside Everyone must be one dream, why we try Why do we try? Baby and I while this moment, we could be the greatest Baby and I while this moment, we could be the worst of all Baby and I while this moment, we could be the greatest Baby and I while this moment, we could be the worst of all We could be the worst of all We could be the worst, the worst of all We could be the worst of all
