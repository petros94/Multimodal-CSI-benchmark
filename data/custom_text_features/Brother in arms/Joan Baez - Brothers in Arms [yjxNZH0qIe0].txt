 Music playing. These miscovered mountains are a home now for me But my home is the lowlands and that always will be Someday you'll return to your valleys and your farms And no longer burn to be brothers in arms. Music playing. Through these fields of destruction, baptisms of fire I have witnessed your suffering as the battle raged on And though it hurt me so bad, in the fear had a lot You did not desert me, my brothers in arms. Music playing. There are many different worlds and a million different songs But we have just one world, while living different ones. Music playing. Now the sun's gone to hell and the moon's riding high Let me meet you farewell, every man has to die And a thredge in the stars to burn, and every light in your path We have rules to make war on our brothers in arms. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing.
