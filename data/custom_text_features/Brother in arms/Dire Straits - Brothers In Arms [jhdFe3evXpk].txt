 Music playing. These mist covered mountains are all now for me. But my home is the lonely lands and always will be. Someday you'll return to your valleys and your farms. And you'll no longer burn to be brothers in arms. Music playing. Through these fields of destruction, baptisms of fire. I've witnessed your suffering as the battle reached high. And the way to help was for better in the fear and the long. You did not desert me, my brothers in arms. There's so many different worlds, so many different souls. And we have just one world, but we live in different worlds. Music playing. Now the sun's gone to hell and the moon's right in high. Letting me bend you farewell. Every man has to die. But it's written in the stars. In every line in your palm. Bare fools to make one arm have brothers in arms. Music playing. you
