 School back in hand, she leaves home in the early morning, waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile. I watch her go with a search of that well-known sadness, and I have to sit down for a while. The feeling that I'm losing her forever, and without really entering the world, I'm glad whenever I can share a laughter, that funny little girl. Sipping through my fingers all the time, I try to capture every minute. The feeling in it, sipping through my fingers all the time, to finally see what's in her mind. Each time I think, I close the knowing, she keeps on growing, sipping through my fingers all the time. Sleeping our eyes, her and me, at the breakfast table, barely awake, I let precious time go by. And when she's gone, days that all melancholy feel, and a sense of guilt, I can't deny. What Heaven to the wonderful would fit in just, the places I have planned for us to go. Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't, and why I just don't know. Sipping through my fingers all the time, I try to capture every minute. The feeling in it, sipping through my fingers all the time, to finally see what's in her mind. Each time I think, I close the knowing, she keeps on growing, sipping through my fingers all the time. Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture, and save it from the fun it takes sometimes. Sipping through my fingers. Sipping through my fingers all the time. Sipping through my fingers all the time. Sipping through my fingers all the time. Skooled back in hand, she leaves home in the early morning, waving goodbye, with an absent-minded smile. you Thank you.
