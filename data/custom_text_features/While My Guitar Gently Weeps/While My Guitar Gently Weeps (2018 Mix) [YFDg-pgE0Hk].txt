 I look at you, the one See the love that's sleeping What am I getting taught, taking weeps? The love at the floor And I see it need sweeping Still am I getting taught, taking weeps? I don't know why nobody told you I do not fall in love I don't know how someone controlled you They bought a soul of you I look at the world And I notice it's turning Why am I getting taught, taking weeps? Every mistake we must surely be learning Still am I getting taught, taking weeps? I don't know why nobody told you I do not fall in love I don't know how you, you were coveted You were coveted too I don't know how you were coveted No one coveted you I look at you all, see the love that's sleeping Why am I getting taught, taking weeps? I don't look at you all Still am I getting taught, taking weeps? I don't look at you all I don't look at you all I don't look at you all I don't look at you all, see the love that's sleeping I don't look at you all, see the love that's sleeping you Thank you.
