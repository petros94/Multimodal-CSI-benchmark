 I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently waits I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently waits I don't know why nobody told you How to unfold your love I don't know how someone controlled you They bought and sold you I look at the world and I know this it's turning While my guitar gently waits With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently waits I don't know why nobody told you How to unfold your love I don't know how someone controlled you They bought and sold you I look at the world and I know this it's turning While my guitar gently waits With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently waits I don't know why nobody told you
