 I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently reeks I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently reeks I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love I don't know how someone controlled you, they bought and sold you I look at the world and I notice it's turning while my guitar gently reeks With every mistake we must surely be learning, still my guitar gently reeks I look at the world and I notice it's turning while my guitar gently reeks I don't know how you were diverted, you were perverted too I don't know how you were diverted, you know one alerted you I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping while my guitar gently reeks I look at you all, still my guitar gently reeks While my guitar gently reeks I look at the world and I notice it's turning while my guitar gently reeks I look at your love gently reeks I look at you all, still my guitar gently reeks I look at you all, still my guitar gently reeks I look at you all, still my guitar gently reeks
