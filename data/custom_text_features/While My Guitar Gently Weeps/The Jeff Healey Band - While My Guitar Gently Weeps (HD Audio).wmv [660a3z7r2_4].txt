 Music playing... I look at you all, see the look there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping But still my guitar gently weeps I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love And I don't know why someone controlled you, they bought him so new I look at the world and I notice it's turning while my guitar gently weeps From every mistake we must surely be learning Yes, but still my guitar gently weeps Music playing... I don't know why you were inverted, you were inverted too And I don't know how you were inverted, no one elected you, they bought him so new I look at you all, see the look there that's sleeping while my guitar gently weeps I look at you all, oh, oh, oh Yes, but still my guitar gently weeps I look at your heart and I notice it's turning while my guitar gently weeps And it's turning while my guitar gently weeps People, people, you're in Music playing... Music playing... Music playing... Music playing... Thank you.
