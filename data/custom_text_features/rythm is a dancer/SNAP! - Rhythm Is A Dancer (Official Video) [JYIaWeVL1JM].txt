 The End. The End. The End. When the men's are dancing, it's a source of anger. People feel it everywhere. Let your hands and voices free your mind and join us. You can feel it in the end. Oh, it's a passion. Oh, you can feel it in the end. Oh, it's a passion. Oh, oh, oh, oh. When the men's are dancing, it's a source of anger. People feel it everywhere. Let your hands and voices free your mind and join us. You can feel it in the end. Oh, it's a passion. Oh, you can feel it in the end. It's a passion. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Well, you can feel it, people feel it. Well, as a dancer. Well, you can feel it, people feel it. Well, as a dancer. Let the rhythm rise. You got to sneak inside. You set your mind to move to your pulsation. Make vibrations and sensations pause. It's not in place. You mind the body. You must be free to please take it all in. Nothing to lose everything to. When men get told you hold you, hold you, not the older. New, touch it, taste it, free yourself with motivation. Got to be what you want to. If the group don't get you, the rhyme will scorn up. I'm serious as cancer when I say rhythm is a dancer. Well, the rhythm is a dancer. It's a source of anger. People feel it everywhere. Let your hands and voices free your mind and join us. You can feel it in the air. Get some passion. You can feel it in the air. Get some passion. Get some passion. Rhythm, you can feel it, people feel it. Rhythm, you can feel it, people feel it.
