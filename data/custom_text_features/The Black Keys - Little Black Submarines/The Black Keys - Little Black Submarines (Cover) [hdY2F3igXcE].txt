 Little black summer reeds, operator please, put me back on line. So my girl, I'll be back, operator please, this is wrecking my mind. Oh, can it be, the voices calling me, they are lost and out of time. I should have seen glow, but everybody knows that a broken up is blind. That a broken up is blind. Pick you up, let you down when I want to go to a place I can hide. You know me, I had plans, but they just disappeared to the back of my mind. Oh, can it be, the voices calling me, they are lost and out of time. I should have seen glow, but everybody knows that a broken up is blind. That a broken up is blind. Oh, can it be, the voices calling me, they are lost and out of time. That a broken up is blind. That a broken up is blind. Oh, can it be, the voices calling me, they are lost and out of time. I should have seen glow, but everybody knows that a broken up is blind. That a broken up is blind. Oh, can it be, the voices calling me, they are lost and out of time. Oh, can it be, the voices calling me, they are lost and out of time. Got it, got it. Got it. Thank you. Thank you.
