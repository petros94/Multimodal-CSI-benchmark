 Little black summer rinse operator please put me back on the line Told my girl I'd be back operator please this is wrecking my mind Oh can it be the voices calling me they get lost and out of time I should have seen it glow but everybody knows that a broken heart is blind Pick you up let you down when I wanna go to a place I can hide You know me I had plans but they just disappeared to the back of my mind Oh can it be the voices calling me they get lost and out of time I should have seen it glow but everybody knows that a broken heart is blind Let a broken heart is blind Music plays Music plays Chant some maps for the teeth of the leader that move back every time Stolen threads and the teeth of the leader that move back to my mind Oh can it be the voices calling me they get lost and out of time I should have seen it glow but everybody knows that a broken heart is blind Let a broken heart is blind Music plays Music plays Music plays Thank you, thank you so much
