 I can't stand the rain against my window Bringing back sweet memories Every window, hey, do you remember How sweet it used to be When we was together Everything was so grand Now that we part There's just one sound that I just can't stand I can't stand the rain against my window Bringing back sweet memories I can't stand the rain against my window Cause he's not here with me Whoa, when the pillow Well, his hair used to lay I know you got some sweet memories But like the window You ain't got nothing to say I can't stand the rain against my window Bringing back sweet memories I can't stand the rain against my window Just keep some harmony Hey, get off my window Cause he's not here with me
