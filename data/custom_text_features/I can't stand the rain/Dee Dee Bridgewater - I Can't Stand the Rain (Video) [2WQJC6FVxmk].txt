 I can't stand the rain against my window Bringing back sweet memories Hey window pane Do you remember How sweet it used to be When we were together Everything was so great But now that we've parted Oh there's just one sound That I just can't stand I can't stand the rain Against my window Bringing back sweet memories I can't stand that rain Oh my window Cause he ain't here with me Alone with the pillow Where his head used to lay I know you've got some sweet memories But like a window You ain't got nothing to say I can't stand the rain No, no, no I can't stand the rain Against my window Bringing back sweet memories I can't stand the rain Against my window It just keeps on haunting me Hey rain, rain Get out of my window Cause he ain't here with me Rain, rain Go away Come again Another day I don't know what I'm gonna do But I'm gonna take it out without you Rain, rain Get out of my window Rain, rain I'm here to shout I'm going on, I'm moving on I'm gonna be me I'm gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna Set myself free Rain, rain Rain, rain Rain, rain Thank you. Thank you.
