 Rain, against my window, sweet memory. I can't stand a rain, against my window. Bringing back sweet memories, I can't stand a rain, against my window. Cause you're not here with me, here in the pain. Do you remember how sweet it used to be, when we were together? Everything was so grand, now that we parted. There's one thing that I just can't stand, I can't stand a rain, against my window. Bringing back sweet memories, I can't stand a rain, against my window. How sweet it used to be. Oh, and to pillow, my hand used to lay. I know you've got some sweet memories, but like a window, you ain't got nothing to say, I can't stand a rain. I can't stand a rain, oh, oh, oh. I can't stand a rain, against my window. Bringing back sweet memories, I can't stand a rain, against my window. Cause she's not here with me. I can't stand a rain, I can't stand a rain, I can't stand a rain, so I just can't stand a rain. Oh, no, I can't stand a rain, so I just can't stand a rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, the rain. I can't stand a rain, how sweet it used to be. I can't stand a rain, I can't stand a rain. Bye.
