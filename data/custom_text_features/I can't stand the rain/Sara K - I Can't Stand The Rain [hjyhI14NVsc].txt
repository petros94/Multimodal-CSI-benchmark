 I can't stand the rain It's against my window And bringing back sweet memories And that window pane Said do you remember how sweet it used to be It was when we were together And everything was so grey Now that we parted, now there's just one sound I can't stand, I can't stand the rain It's against my window now And bringing back sweet memories And that window pane Said don't you remember how sweet it used to be It was on that pillow Where your head used to lay Oh, just like that pillow I can't hear it, I can't hear it, no And I can't stand And I can't stand the rain It's against my window now And bringing back sweet memories And that window pane And that window pane I can't stand the rain It's against my window now And bringing back sweet memories I can't stand the rain Not what it'd be saying Something about all the peace and harmony I can't stand that rain No, no, no I can't stand that rain My, my, my I can't stand that rain All that I talk about, a peace and a harmony Thank you for watching!
