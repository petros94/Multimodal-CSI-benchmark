 I.. I need to find time. So my mama said you can't hurry back. No, you just have to wait. She said I'll come easy. But it's a game of good and take. You can't hurry back. No, you just have to wait. Just trust in the girl. And I have the long it takes. How many heartaches must I stand? And if all I find is love, to live, to live again. Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on. When I feel my strength, who it's almost gonna remember. Mama said, hurry now. No, you just have to wait. She said I'll come easy. It's a game of good and take. How long must I wait? How much more must I take? Before I only mess? What caused my heart to heartbreak? No, I can't wait. To live my life alone. I'm grown impatient for love. To call my own. But when I feel that I, I can't go on. For these precious words, keep me hanging on. I remember Mama said, hurry now. No, you just have to wait. She said I'll come easy. Well, it's a game of good and take. You can't hurry back. No, you just have to wait. Just trust in the girl. And I have the long it takes. When I'm free. Now love, love, it doesn't come easy. But I keep on waiting. And to stop hating for that soft voice, talk to me at night. For some tender arms. Oh, when we're tired, I keep waiting. To a thing. But it ain't easy. You know it ain't easy. Mama said, you can't hurry back. No, you just have to wait. She said love, don't come easy. But it's a game of good and take. You can't hurry back. No, you just have to wait. She said love, don't come easy. It's a game of good and take. You can't hurry back.
