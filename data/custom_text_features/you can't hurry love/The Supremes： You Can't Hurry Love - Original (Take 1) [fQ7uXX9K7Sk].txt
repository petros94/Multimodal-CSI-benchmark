 I need love, love to ease my mind I need to find someone to call my mind When mama said, can't hurry love, no you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take Can't hurry love, no you just have to wait You gotta trust, give it time No matter how long it takes How many heartaches must I stand before I find a time to forget Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on When I feel my strength is almost gone I remember mama said, no you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take How long must I wait How much more than I take Before loneliness will cause my heart to break I've been waiting, I've been taking No I can't bear to live my life alone I grow impatient for our love to call my own But when I feel that I, I can't go on These precious words keeps me hanging on I remember mama said, no you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take Can't hurry love, no you just have to wait You gotta trust, give it time No matter how long it takes No love love don't come easy But I keep on waiting I'm dissipating for that soft voice So talk to me at night For something that owns to hold me tight I keep on waiting, keep on waiting But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy Mama said, no you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take Can't hurry love, no you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take Can't hurry love, no you just have to wait Mama said, no you just have to wait Mama said, no you just have to wait Give and time, no matter how long it takes Can't hurry love, no you just have to wait Better faith, love don't come easy you
