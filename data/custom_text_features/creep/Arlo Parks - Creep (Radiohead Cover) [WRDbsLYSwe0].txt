 You When you were here before Can look you in the eye Just like an angel Skin makes me cry You float like a feather In a beautiful Wish I was special You're so fucking But I'm a creep What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong Don't care if it hurts I want to have control Want a perfect boy Want a perfect soul I want you to know When I'm not around You're so fucking special I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a widow What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong And she is running Out the door She's running she runs she runs she runs Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so fucking special I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a widow What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong I don't belong I don't belong You You Thank you. Thank you.
