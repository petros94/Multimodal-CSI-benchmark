 When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry You float like a feather in a beautiful world I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special But I'm a creep, I'm a murderer What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I don't care if you're nice, I wanna have control, I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul I want you to notice what I'm not around, you're so fuckin' special I wish I was special, but I'm a creep, I'm a winner alone What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here She's living again, she's living to the point where I'm not around Alone What makes you happy? Whatever you want, you're so fuckin' special I wish I was special, but I'm a creep, I'm a winner alone What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
