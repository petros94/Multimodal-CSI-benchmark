 When you were here before I couldn't look you in the eyes You're just like an angel Your skin makes me cry You float like a feather In a beautiful world I don't wish I was special You're so very special But I'm a creep I'm a winner I feel my truth I don't belong here I don't care if it hurts I wanna have control I want a perfect body I want a perfect soul I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so very special How I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a winner What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here Well, well, she's running out again She's running out She's running, running, running, running Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so very special I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a winner What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I don't belong here
