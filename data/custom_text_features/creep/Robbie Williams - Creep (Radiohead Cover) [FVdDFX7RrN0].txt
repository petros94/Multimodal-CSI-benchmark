 How lovely. That was a lovely moment. When you were here before, I couldn't look you in the eye. You're just like an angel. Your skin makes me cry. You float like a feather in a beautiful world. I wish I was special. I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? I'm a lonely, poor, here in the next. I wanna have control. I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul. I want you to notice when I'm not around. You're so special. I wish I was. I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want. You're so special. I wish I was special. But I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here. I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here. I don't belong here. I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? Thank you for watching!
