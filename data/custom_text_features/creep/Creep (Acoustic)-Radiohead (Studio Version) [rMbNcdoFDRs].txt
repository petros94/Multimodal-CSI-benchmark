 When you're here before, couldn't look you in the eye But just like an angel, your skin makes me cry You float like a feather in a beautiful world I wish I was special, you're so very special And I'm a creep, I'm a whiter, what the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here, but don't care if it hurts I wanna have control, I wanna perfect God in I wanna perfect soul, I watch it and notice When I'm not around, you're so very special I wish I was special, but I'm a creep, I'm a whiter, what the hell am I doing here? When I don't belong here, whoa, whoa, she's running out again She's running out, she's running, running, running Run, run Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want You're so very special, I wish I was special But I'm a creep, I'm a whiter, what the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here, I don't belong here you
