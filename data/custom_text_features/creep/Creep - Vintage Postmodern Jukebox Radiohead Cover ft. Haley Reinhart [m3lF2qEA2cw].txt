I don't belong here I don't care if it hurts I wanna have control I want the perfect body I want a perfect soul And I want you to know it hurts When I'm right around you You're so very special Yeah, I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a winner I'm a winner What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here Oh, oh, oh She always Was she running out of there? I said she was running out She was running out She was running out I said she was running out She was running out Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so very special Yeah, I wish I was special But I'm a creep I said I'm a winner What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I'm a creep I'm a winner What the hell am I doing here? Oh, oh, oh I don't belong here I don't belong here I don't belong here I don't belong here I don't belong here I don't belong here
