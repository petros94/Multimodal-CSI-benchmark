 Music Psychic spice from China try to steal your modulation Little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotations And if you want this kind of dreams it's californication Music It's the edge of the world and no the western civilization The sun may rise in the east at least it settles in the final location It's understood that Hollywood sells californication Music Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging Celebrity skin is desert chain or is that war you're waging First born unicorn, hardcore softborn Dream of californication Dream of californication Music Marry me girl be my fairy to the world be my very own constellation A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information And buy me a star on the boulevard is californication Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement Cobain cane you hear the spheres singing songs off station station And now the road's not far away it's californication Born and raised by those who praise control of population Everybody's been there and I don't need no vacation First born unicorn, hardcore softborn Dream of californication Dream of californication Destruction leads to a very rare fraud but it also breeds creation And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they just another good vibration Entire ways couldn't save the world from californication Music Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging Secret in the rest there is no test but this is what you crave First born unicorn, hardcore softborn Dream of californication Dream of californication Dream of californication Dream of californication Music
