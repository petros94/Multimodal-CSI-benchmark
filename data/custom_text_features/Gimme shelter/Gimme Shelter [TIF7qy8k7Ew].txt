 Music playing. The storm is threatening my very life today. If I don't get some shelter, we're gonna fade away. Won't you run? It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Won't you run? It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Won't you run? Oh, see the fire's sweeping our very streets today. It burns like a red cold carpet. My blue lost his way. Won't you run? It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Won't you run? It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Won't you run? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Rainwater, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Rainwater, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Rainwater, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Won't you run? It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Won't you run? It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. Give me, give me, give me shelter. I'm gonna fade away. Won't you run? It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away. It's just a shot away. Oh, I tell you, love's his turn. It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away. Left love on his kisses, left love on her. Left love on his love, left love on his love. It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away. We need a kiss today. Oh, for peace today. This is the end of the way. It's just a kiss away. you
