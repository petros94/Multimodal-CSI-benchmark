 Music plays Oh, a storm is strapping my bare-ass life today If I don't get some shelter, yeah, I'm gonna fade away Watchin' them, it's just a shadowing, it's just a shadowing Oh, I see fire sweeping, I'm ever street today Birds like a round cold coming, my ballin' lost its way Watchin' them, it's just a shadowing, it's just a shadowing Watchin' them, it's just a shadowing, it's just a shadowing Music plays Music plays Oh, the flood is threatening my very life today Give me a, give me a shelter, oh, I'm gonna fade away Watchin' them, it's just a shadowing, it's just a shadowing Watchin' them, it's just a shadowing, it's just a shadowing Oh, I see fire, just a kiss away, just a kiss away, just a kiss away, just a kiss away Music plays I'd turn it off And make you fall It's just a kiss away It's just a kiss away Just a kiss away Just a kiss away Kiss away Kiss away Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh You you Thank you.
