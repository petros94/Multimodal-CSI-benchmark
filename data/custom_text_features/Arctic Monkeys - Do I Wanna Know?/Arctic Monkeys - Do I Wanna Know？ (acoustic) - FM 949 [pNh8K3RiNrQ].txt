 Have you got color in your cheeks? Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide that sticks around like summits in your teeth? Are there some aces up your sleeve? Have you no idea that you're in deep? I dreamt about you nearly every night this week How many secrets can you keep? Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow And I play it on repeat Until I fall asleep spilling drinks on my set teeth Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways? Set to see you go We started hoping that you'd stay baby we both know That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say Tomorrow day crawling back to you Ever thought I'd call and win? You've had a few cause I always do Well maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new And now I've thought it through crawling back to you So have you got the guts? Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shows Simmer down on poker room I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the course I'll try in to kiss you I don't know if you feel the same as I do But we could be together If you wanted to Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways? Set to see you go We started hoping that you'd stay baby we both know That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say Tomorrow day crawling back to you Ever thought I'd call and win? You've had a few cause I always do Well maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new And now I've thought it through crawling back to you If this feeling flows both ways? We started hoping that you'd stay That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say Tomorrow day, yeah Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways? Set to see you go Ever thought I'd call and win? Do you want me crawling back to you? It's a long day at the time Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! you Thank you.
