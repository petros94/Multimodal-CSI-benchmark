 Have you got color in your cheeks? Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type that sticks around like summer's in your teeth? Now there's some aces up your sleeve, have you no idea that you're in deep? I dreamt about you nearly every night this week, how many secrets can you keep? Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat Until I fall asleep, spilling drinks on my city Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways? Sad to see you go home, I'm sorta hoping that you'd stay, baby we both know that the nights are mainly made for saying things that you can't say Tomorrow day, calling back to you Have I thought of calling when you've had a few, cause I always do, and maybe I'm too busy being useful for somebody new Now I've thought it through, calling back to you So have you got the guts? Been wondering if your hearts are open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts Is there my down and parkour up? I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you I don't know if you feel the same as I do, we could be together If you wanted to, do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways? Sad to see you go home, I'm sorta hoping that you'd stay, baby we both know that the nights are mainly made for saying things that you can't say Tomorrow day, calling back to you Have I thought of calling when you've had a few, cause I always do, and maybe I'm too busy being useful for somebody new Now I've thought it through Thank you for watching!
