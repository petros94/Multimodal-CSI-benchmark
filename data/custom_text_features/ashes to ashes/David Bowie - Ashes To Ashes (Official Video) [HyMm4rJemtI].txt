 Do you remember a God that's been In such an ugly song I've heard a rumor from Ground Control Oh no, don't say it's true They got a message for the actual man I hope you're happy too I've loved all of needed love Solid details run away But she came when nothing was given Just to get to the chapter of the insufficiency And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hands I've felt this little insufficiency in my blood But I'm hoping to kick the good gladed It's glowing, glowing, glowing Ashes to ash and fun to fuck it We know major talks are junky Strung out in heaven's mind Living that all time long Time went again not to myself I'd stay here tonight But the little green wheels are following me Oh no, not again I'm stuck with a valuable friend I hope you're happy too One flash of light but no smoking crystal I've never done good things I've never done bad things I've never did anything out of the blue Want an extra break, the axe Want to come down right now Ashes to ash and fun to fuck it We know major talks are junky Strung out in heaven's mind Living that all time long My mother said to get this done You better not mess with major talks My mother said to get this done You better not mess with major talks My mother said to get this done You better not mess with major talks My mother said to get this done You better not mess with major talks You better not mess with major talks You better not mess with major talks You better not mess with major talks Thank you.
