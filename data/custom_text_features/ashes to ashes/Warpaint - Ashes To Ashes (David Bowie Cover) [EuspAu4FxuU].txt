 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Do you remember a guy that's been in such a madder song? I've heard a rumor from ground control. Oh no, don't say it's true. It's got a message for the action man. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. I've left all I needed there, so did details from the way. The shrieking had nothing to do with it. Just pictures of jacquero's instances. I know I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair. I'm hoping to kick back the planet, it's glowing, glowing, glowing. I should still lie, should I funk to funky? We never made your tongues a junkie. Stuck out in heaven, hiding in an old tunnel. Music playing. Time and again I tell myself, I'll stay clean tonight. The lily green wheels are following me. Oh no, not again. I'm stuck with the valuable friend. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. One flash of light, but no smoking crystal. I've never done good things, I've never done bad things. I've never did anything out of the blue. Wanting legs to break the ice, I wanna come down right now. I should still lie, should I funk to funky? We never made your tongues a junkie. Stuck out in heaven, hiding in an old tunnel. My love has said to get things done, you better not mess with a major tone. My love has said to get things done, you better not mess with a major tone. My love has said to get things done, you better not mess with a major tone. My love has said to get things done, you better not mess with a major tone. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Thank you.
