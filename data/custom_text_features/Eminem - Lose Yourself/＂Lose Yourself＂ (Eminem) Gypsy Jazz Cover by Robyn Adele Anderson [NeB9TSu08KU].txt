 POMPS His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy cause he's vomit on His sweat already pops again He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs But he keeps on to get a word he wrote down The whole crowd goes so loud Your binge is now, but the words won't come out He's choking now, everybody's choking now The clock's run out, time's up over blouse Now back to reality, oh, there goes gravity Oh, there goes gravity, joke, he's on gravity, won't give up That is he, no, he won't have it, he knows his own back Said he's broke, don't matter, he's dope, he knows That body's broken, so stacked that he knows When he goes back to his mom, oh, that's when it's back to the lab And yo, this whole rhapsody, go catch her this moment And hope it don't pass and lose yourself in the music The moment you're on it, you better never let it go You only got one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it You better never let it go You only got one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better... The souls escaping through this hole That escaping as world as mine Through the taking, make me king As we move to a new world order I know my life is for the superstars Close to post-mortem, it only grows hotter Only grows hotter, he blows us all over His hose is on the line, I'm close to ghost shows He's known as the globetrotter, lonely roads, god only knows He's grown and bothered from home, it's no bother He goes home and barely knows his own daughter Hold your nose, cause it goes cold water His hose don't want it, I'm always cold-brother He moves on till the next smoke flows And those don't, so I'm not a so-to-so-brother It's holding on, both I suppose it's all one But the beat goes on, and I'm done to numb You better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it You better never let it go You only got one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it You better never let it go You only got one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better...
