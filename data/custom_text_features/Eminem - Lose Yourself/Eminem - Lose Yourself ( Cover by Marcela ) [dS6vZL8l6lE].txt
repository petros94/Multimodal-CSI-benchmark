 Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment would you capture it or just let it slip? His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, there's vomit on his sweater already, arms forget his nerves, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud, he opens his mouth but the words won't come out, he's choking how, everybody's choking out, the clocks run out, time's up, overblast, snap back to reality, oh, the ghost gravity, oh, the ghost rabbit, he's so mad but he won't give up, that is he know, he won't have it, he knows, he's all back to his roots, he don't matter, he's so, he knows that but he's broke, he's so standin', he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap city battle will capture this moment and hope it don't, you better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it, you better never let it go, go, you only get one shot, and now miss your chance to blow this opportunity, come once in a lifetime, better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it, you better never let it go, go, you only get one shot, and now miss your chance to blow this opportunity, come once in a lifetime, his soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping, this world is mine for the taking, make me a king, as we move toward a new world, a normal life is boring but superstardom's close to post-modern, it only grows harder, only grows harder, he blows his own love at us, his own autumn, ghost to ghost shows, he's a known as globe trotter, lonely roads, god only knows, he's one father from home, he's no father, he goes home and better knows his own daughter, but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water, these girls don't want him no more, he's cold product, they moved on to the next mode, who flows, he knows dove and so not, so the soap opera, it's on fads, I suppose it's all part now, but the beat goes on, don't you better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it, you better never let it go, go you only get one shot, now miss your chance to blow this opportunity, comes once in a lifetime, better lose yourself in the music, the moment you own it, you better never let it go, go you only get one shot, now miss your chance to blow this opportunity, comes once in a lifetime, do better do better you you you you Thank you.
