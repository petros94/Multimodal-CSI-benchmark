His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, his vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti, he's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready to drop palms, but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud, he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out, he's choking how, everybody's choking now, the clock's run out, time's up, over, plow, snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh, there goes gravity, he's so mad, but he won't give up, daddy's he know, he won't have it, he knows, it's all back to these ropes, it don't matter, he's tone, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows, it's all back to this mobile home, that's when it's back to the lab again, yo, this old rap city, better go capture this moment, I hope it don't get it.
