 I had a dream I got everything I wanted Not what you think And if I'm being honest I'd have been a nightmare To anyone who might care Thought I could fly So I stepped off the golden Nobody cried Nobody even noticed I'm standing right there Kinda thought they might care I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see You with me And you say As long as I'm here No one can hurt you No one will lie here But you can learn too If I could change The way that you see yourself You would have wondered why you're here They don't deserve you I tried to scream But my head wasn't a word They call me weak I'm not just somebody's daughter Could have been a nightmare Felt like they were right there And it feels like yesterday was a year ago I don't want to let anybody know Cause everybody wants something from me now And I don't want to let them down I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see You with me And you say No one can hurt you No one will lie here But you can learn too If I could change The way that you see yourself You would have wondered why you're here They don't deserve you If I knew it all then Would I do it again? Would I do it again? If they knew it they'd say Would they say instead If I knew it all then Would I do it again? If they knew it they'd say Would go straight to my head Would would they say instead If I knew it all then you you
