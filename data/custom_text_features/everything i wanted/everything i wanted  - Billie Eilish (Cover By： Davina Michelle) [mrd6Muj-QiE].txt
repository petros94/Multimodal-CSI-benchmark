 I had a dream, I got everything I wanted Not what you think, and if I'm being honest It might have been a nightmare to anyone I might care Thought I could fly, so I stepped off the golden Nobody cried, nobody even noticed I saw them standing right there, kinda thought they might care I had a dream, I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see you with me And you say, as long as I'm here No one can hurt you, I don't wanna lie here But you can learn too, if I could change the way that you see yourself You don't want to lie here, they don't deserve you I tried to scream, but my head was underwater They called me weak, like I'm not just somebody's daughter Could have been a nightmare, but it felt like they were right there When it feels like yesterday was a year ago But I don't wanna let anybody know Cause everybody wants something for me now And I don't wanna let them know And you say, as long as I'm here No one can hurt you, I don't wanna lie here But you can learn too, if I could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why here, they don't deserve you I had a dream, I got everything I wanted Thank you.
