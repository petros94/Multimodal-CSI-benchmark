 I had a dream I got everything I wanted Now what you think? And if I'm being honest I might have been the nightmare To anyone in my care Thought I could fly So I stepped off the golden Nobody cried Nobody even noticed I saw them standing right there I kinda thought they might care I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see you with me And you say as long as I'm here No one can hurt you Don't want to lie here But you can lie or do If I could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why here They don't deserve you I tried to scream But my head was underwater They called me weak Like I'm not somebody's daughter It could have been the nightmare But it felt like they were right there And it feels like yesterday was a hero call But I don't want to let anybody know Cause everybody wants something from me now And I don't want to let them down I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see you with me And you say as long as I'm here No one can hurt you Don't want to lie here But you can lie or do If I could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why here They don't deserve you As long as I'm here No one can hurt you Don't want to lie here But you can lie or do If I could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why here They don't deserve you Hmm Hmm Hmm Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh you
