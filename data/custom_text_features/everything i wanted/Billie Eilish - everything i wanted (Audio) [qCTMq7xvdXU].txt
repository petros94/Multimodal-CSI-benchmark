 I had a dream I got everything I wanted Not what you think And if I'm being honest It might have been a nightmare To anyone who might care Thought I could fly So I stepped off the golden Nobody cried Nobody even noticed I saw them standing right there Kinda thought they might care I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see you with me And you say, as long as I'm here No one can hurt you Don't wanna lie to you But you can learn to Never could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why here They don't deserve you I tried to scream But my head was underwater They called me weak Like I'm not just somebody's daughter It could have been a nightmare But it felt like they were right there And it feels like yesterday was a year ago But I don't wanna let anybody know Cause everybody wants something from me now And I don't wanna let them down I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up I see you with me And you say, as long as I'm here No one can hurt you Don't wanna lie to you But you can learn to Never could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why here They don't deserve you If I knew it all then would I do it again? If they knew what they said Would go straight to my head Or would they say instead? If I knew it all then would I do it again? If they knew what they said Would go straight to my head Or would they say instead? Thanks for watching! you Thank you.
