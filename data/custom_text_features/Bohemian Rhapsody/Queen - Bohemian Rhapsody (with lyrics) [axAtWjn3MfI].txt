 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide? Though escaped from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a blue boy, I need no sympathy Because I'm easy cub, easy gore, little high, little low Anywhere the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me Mama just killed a man, put a gun against his head Pilled my trigger, now he's dead Mama life had just begun But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooh, did lead to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, does it nothing really matter? Mama's gone Too late, my time has come Since she must have lost my spine Body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh, did lead to make you cry I don't wanna die Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all Mama, ooh, did lead to make you cry Mama, ooh, did lead to make you cry I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the pandango? Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Pika, my boy I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family Sparing his life from this one drossin' tea Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? Bismillah, no, we will not let you go Let him go, Bismillah, we will not let you go Let him go, Bismillah, we will not let you go Let me go, we'll not let you go Let me go, we'll not let you go Never let me go Oh mama mia, mama mia Mama mia, let me go The mountain book has a devil born aside for me For me, for me So you think you can stop me and spend my life So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh baby, can't do this to me baby Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters, anything really matters to me. Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters, anyone can see
