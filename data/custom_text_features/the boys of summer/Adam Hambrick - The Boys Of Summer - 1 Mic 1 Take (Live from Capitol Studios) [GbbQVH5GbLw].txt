 I'm Adam Hambrick. This song is called Boys of Summer and this is One Mic, One Take. Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach, I feel it in the air, the summer's out over each empty lakes, empty streets, the sun goes down long. I'm driving by your house though I know you're not home. I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun, you got your hair slicked back and sunglasses on, baby. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys have summer gone. Never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream, never have you made me crazy, never have made you scream. I don't understand what happened to our love, baby when I get you back, I'm gonna show you what I made of. I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun, I see you walking real slow and you're smiling at everyone. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys have summer gone. Out on the road, day I saw a Garth Brooks, a cigarette on a caravan, a little voice inside my head said, don't look back, you can never look back. I thought I knew what love was, what did I know? Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go but I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun, you got the top of the down, rainy or warm, baby. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys have summer gone. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys have summer gone. Music playing. Yeah, I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun, you got your head straight back, wave faris on baby. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys have summer, summer have gone. Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh. I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun, you got your head straight back and wave faris on baby. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys have summer, summer have gone. Music playing.
