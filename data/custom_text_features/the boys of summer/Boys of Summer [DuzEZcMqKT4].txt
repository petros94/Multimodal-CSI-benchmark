 I'm not sure what to do with this. I'm just going to play it. Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach. I feel it in the air, the summer sound of rich empty lake empty streets. The sun goes down alone. I'm driving by your house, do I know you're not home? I can see you, your brows can't shine in the sun, you got your hair gone back in your sunglasses, son baby. And I can tell you my love for you will seal this room after the voice of summer have gone. I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream. Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream. Now I don't understand what happened to our love. But baby I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I made of. I can see you, your brows can't shine in the sun, I see you walking real slow and smiling at everyone. And I can tell you my love for you will seal this room after the voice of summer have gone. I can see you, your brows can't shine in the sun, you got your hair gone back in your sunglasses, son baby. And I can tell you my love for you will seal this room after the voice of summer have gone. I don't know what happened, I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened today, I saw a dead hair sticking on the card and like a little voice inside my head said, Don't look back, you can never look back. I thought I knew what love was, but did I know those days are gone forever. I should just let them go, but I can see you, your brows can't shine in the sun, you got the top pole down and you're ready to go, baby. And I can tell you my love for you will seal this room after the voice of summer have gone. I can see you, your brows can't shine in the sun, you got your hair slicked back in your nose, you got your hair gone back in your sunglasses, son baby. And I can tell you my love for you will seal this room after the voice of summer have gone. Thank you for watching. Thank you for watching. Thank you for watching.
