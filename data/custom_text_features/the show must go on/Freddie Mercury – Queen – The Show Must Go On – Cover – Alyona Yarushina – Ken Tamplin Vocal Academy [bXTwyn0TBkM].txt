 Empty spaces, what are we living for? Abandoned places, I guess we know the scar On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for? Another hero, another mindless cry behind the curtain in the patch of mud Oh, does anybody want to take it anymore? Show my scar, show my scar, yeah Inside my heart is breaking, my makeup may be flaking but my smile still stays on Whatever happens, I live it all to chance, another heartache, another fatal romance, on and on Does anybody know what we are living for? Guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now, I'll soon be turning Around the corner now, outside the door is breaking, but inside in the dark I'm making it to be free Show my scar, show my scar, yeah Inside my heart is breaking, my makeup may be flaking but my smile still stays on Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh My soul is painted like the wind of butterflies, fell in chains and yesterday we grow but never die I can die, I am a pain, show my scar, yeah Show my scar, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I'm facing with a grin, I'm never giving in, I'm with a shock Ooh, I toughen the bill, I'm overkill, I have to find a way to carry on with the show Show my scar, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Find a stroke, find a stroke, yeah, yeah, yeah, find a stroke, oh, find a stroke
