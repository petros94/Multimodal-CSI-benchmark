 The End. Empty spaces, what are we living for? I've been to places, I guess we know the score, on and on Does anybody know what we are looking for? Another hero, another mindless crime Behind the curtain, near the pantomime Whole life, does anybody want to take it anymore? Show must go on! Show must go on! Yeah! Inside my heart is breaking My makeup may be flicking but my smile Still stays on Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance And not a heartache, not a failure, I'll never On and on, does anybody know what we are living for? I guess I'm running, I must be warm and now I'll soon be turning, round the corner now Outside the dawn is breaking My inside and the dark are making dinner free Show must go on! Inside my heart is breaking My makeup may be flicking but my smile Still stays on Yeah! My soul is painted like the wings of other flies Femur and tales of yesterday, but gold I'll never die I can fly, my breath Show must go on! Show must go on! I'll face it with a grin I'll never give in I'm with the shine Show! I'll talk to you, I'll love again I have to find a way to carry on Show must go on! Show must go on! Show must go on! Show must go on! Thank you.
