 You You Empty spaces what are we living for? abandoned places I guess we know this song Does anybody know what we are looking for? another hero another mindless cry behind the curtain in the pantomime Oh, does anybody want to take it anymore? Show my skin Show my skin Inside my heart is breaking My makeup may be flaking but my smile Still stays on Whatever happens, I leave it all to chance Another heartache, another failed romance Oh, does anybody know what we are living for? I guess I'm learning I must be warm enough I'll still be turning Round the corner now Outside the door is breaking But inside in the dark I'll make it so be free Show my skin Show my skin Show my skin Inside my heart is breaking My makeup may be flaking but my smile Still stays on My soul is paging like the wings of butterflies Fairy tales of yesterday were broke but never died I can fly like my friends Show must go on Show must go on I'll face it with a grin I've never given in I'll be the show I've talked the bill I love a kill I have to find the will to carry on With the show Show Show Show Show Show Show Show Show Show
