 We passed up on the stairs, we spoke and wasn't well, although I wasn't there I said I was a sprain, which came as a surprise I spoke into his eyes, I thought you'd died alone, a long, long time ago Although, I mean, we never lost control, the face to face, other than this old world I laughed and shook his hand, I made my way back home, I searched for a far, far land again Years and years I roamed, I gazed up, gazed at stair, we must have million years, I must have died alone A long, long time ago Who knows, not me, I never lost control, your face to face, with the most old world Who knows, not me, we never lost control, your face to face, with the most old world Who knows, not me, we never lost control, your face to face, with the most old world Who knows, not me, we never lost control, your face to face, with the most old world Who knows, not me, we never lost control, your face to face, with the most old world Thank you for watching!
