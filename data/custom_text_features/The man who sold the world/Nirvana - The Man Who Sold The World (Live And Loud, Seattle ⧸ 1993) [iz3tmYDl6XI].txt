 We passed up on the stairs, the smoking was around, although I wasn't well. I said I was his friend. We're screaming, start surprised. I spoke into his hands, I thought we'd died a long, long time ago. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Your face, to face with the madness of the world. My life's a super sound, I made my way back home, I searched for the light. Years and years I roam, I gaze up, gaze me stand, for all our billions here we must have died alone, a long, long time ago. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Your face, to face with the madness of the world. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Your face, to face with the madness of the world. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Your face, to face with the madness of the world. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Your face, to face with the madness of the world. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Your face, to face with the madness of the world. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Your face, to face with the madness of the world. Who knows? God, babe, we never lost control. Thank you. Thank you.
