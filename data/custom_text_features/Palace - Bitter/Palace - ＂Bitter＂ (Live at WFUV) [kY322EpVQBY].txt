 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Let me your brakes again, your northern might speak. I played hard strings before but, what in your key? You tell me you're waiting for someone but, have a kiss. You broke my inner promise to me so, forget your word. And again and again you're breaking me down. Let me in, let me in for the darker this time, now. Why am I a pit-a-pit-a-pit-a? Why am I always led to a spray? Only get better, better, better. I know what you say, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. Music playing. Tell me you're angry to come and I love you more. Right half a cup against right, down to my car. Striking up like an in-strike raid. On my skin, well masked to cover myself in the secret footprint. And again and again you're breaking me down. Let me in, let me in for the darker this time, now. Why am I a pit-a-pit-a-pit-a? Why am I always led to a spray? Only get better, better, better. I know what you say, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. Music playing. Oh. Music playing. Oh. Music playing. Oh.
