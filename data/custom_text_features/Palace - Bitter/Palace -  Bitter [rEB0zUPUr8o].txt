 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Let me up bricks again y'all. On my speed. I play hard strings before I. And your key. You tell me you're waiting for someone but. You haven't heard now. The broken promise just took me so. Forgot the world of the road. Let it get it again you're breaking me down. Let me in let me in stop this now. Why am I bitter bitter bitter? Why am I always late at night? It's gonna get bitter bitter bitter. I'll always be safe. Tell me I'm breaking the night. Love you more. Right I think I'll be good as right. Without the mic on. It's striking up like an airstrike. All under my skin. I wear a mask to cover myself. And the shape of a grin. Oh and again and again you're breaking me down. Let me in let me in stop this now. Why am I bitter bitter bitter? Why am I always late at night? It's gonna get bitter bitter bitter. I'll always be safe. I'll always be safe. I'll always be safe. I'll always be safe. I'll always be safe. I'll always be safe. I'll always be safe. I'll always be safe.
