 Hi, we're London Grammar. This is our biz session. The first song we're going to do for you is A Cover, originally done by Chris Isaac. It's called Wicked Game. The world was on fire and no one can save me but you. Strange what desire can make foolish people do. And I never dream that I'd meet somebody like you. I never dream that I'd know somebody like you. And no I don't want to fall in love. And no I don't want to fall in love. With you. What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you. What a wicked thing to say to make me feel this way. What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you. What a wicked thing to say to make me feel this way. No I don't want to fall in love. And no I don't want to fall in love with you. With you. With you. With you. With you. With you. With you. With you. you you
