 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Francis Kinney man died of a big disease with a little name. By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same. At home there were 17 year old boys and there I did fun. His beard and a gang called the disciples high on crack. He told him I'm a machine gun. Time, times. Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside. You turn on the telly and every other story is telling you somebody died. My sister killed her baby cause she couldn't afford to feed it. And it was sending people to the moon. In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time. Now he's doing horse, it's joe. Times, times. Cilling on when a rocket ship explodes and everybody still wants to fly. But something said man ain't happenless man truly dies. Oh, I, time. Time. Baby make a speech, star wars fly, neighbors just shine at home. But if a night falls and a bomb falls, will everybody see the dawn? Time, times. Cilling on when a rocket goes and everybody still wants to fly. But something made it happen truly until man truly dies. Oh, I, oh I, time. Time. Time. Silent time, that's what your mind heard before it's too late. It's fallin' love, keepin' there, have a good day. We're callin' Nate if it's a boy. Time.
