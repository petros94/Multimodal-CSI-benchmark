 Music playing. Here's a little song I wrote. You might want to sing it note for note. Don't worry. Be happy. In every life we have some trouble. But when you worry you make it double. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy now. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Ain't got no place to lay your head. Somebody came and took your bed. Don't worry. Be happy. The landlord say your rent is lit. He may have to lit the gate. But don't worry. Be happy. Look at me, I'm happy. Don't worry. Be happy. I give you my phone number. When you worry call me, I make you happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style. Ain't got no girl to make you smile. But don't worry. Be happy. Cause when you worry your face will frown. And that will bring everybody down. So don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy now. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't do it. Be happy. Put a smile on your face. Don't bring everybody down. Make this. Don't worry. It will soon pass whatever it is. Don't worry. Be happy. I'm not worried.
