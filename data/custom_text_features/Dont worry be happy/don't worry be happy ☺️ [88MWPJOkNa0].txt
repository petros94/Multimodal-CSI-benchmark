 Hello everybody. Happy Mealick Monday. Here's a little song in case you need it today. Here's a little song that I wrote. You might want to sing an old folk note. Don't worry. Be happy. In every life we have some trouble, but when you worry, make it double. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy now. Don't worry. Be happy. In God no place to lay your hat, somebody came and took your bed. Don't worry. Be happy. The landlord said you're a rendition. He may have to litigate. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Don't worry. Be happy. In God no cash, in God no style, in God no girl to make you smile. Don't worry. Be happy. Cause when you worry your face will frown, and that will bring everybody down. So don't worry. Be happy. Sing it with me now. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy now. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry. Be happy now.
