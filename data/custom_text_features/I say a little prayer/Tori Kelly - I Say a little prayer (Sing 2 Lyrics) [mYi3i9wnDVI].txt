 I say a little prayer for you The moment I wake up Before I put on my makeup I say a little prayer for you I'm combing my hair now And wondering what to wear now I say a little prayer for you Forever, ever You're playing my heart and I'll be loving you Forever, ever We have a good part and all Together, together To live without you Will only be heartbreak for me I run for the bus deal But where did nothing go? I still say I say a little Oh, oh, oh At work I just take time And not the one coffee break time I say a little prayer for you Forever, ever Oh, yeah I will love you Forever, ever I will love you Together, together To live without you Will only be heartbreak for me Only be heartbreak for me Oh, oh, oh Transcribed by ESO, translated by â€”
