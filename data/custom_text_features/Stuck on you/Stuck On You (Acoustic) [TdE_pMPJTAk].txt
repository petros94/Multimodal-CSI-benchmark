 I'm stuck on you, I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose Guess I'm on my way Needed a friend, and the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you till the end Guess I'm on my way, I'm mighty glad you stayed I'm stuck on you, being a fool for too long I guess it's time for me to come home Guess I'm on my way So hard to see that a man like you could wait around for a girl like me Guess I'm on my way, mighty glad you stayed I'm stuck on you, being a fool for too long Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow And I know just where I'm going I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away Cause there's some little darling I'm coming home to stay I'm stuck on you, I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose Guess I'm on my way Needed a friend, and the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you till the end Guess I'm on my way, I'm mighty glad you stayed I'm mighty glad you stayed I'm on my way I'm stuck on you, being a fool for too long
