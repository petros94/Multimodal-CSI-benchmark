 Music playing. Music playing. In the way you feel I will get shot be with you till the end. Cause I'm on my way. Mighty glad you stayed. Stuck on you. Been a fool too long I guess it's time for me to come on home. Cause I'm on my way. And it's so hard to see that a guy like you could wait around for a girl like me. Cause I'm on my way. Mighty glad you stayed. Mmm. I'm leaving on the midnight train tomorrow. And I'll just swear I'm going. I've packed so much rubbles enough. Throw them all away. It's just a little time. I'm coming home this day. It's time. I'm stuck on you. Yeah this feeling sounds deep in my soul. I'll let it just get loose. Cause I'm on my way. I need a friend. And the way you feel I guess I'll be with you till the end. Cause I'm on my way. Mighty glad you stayed.
