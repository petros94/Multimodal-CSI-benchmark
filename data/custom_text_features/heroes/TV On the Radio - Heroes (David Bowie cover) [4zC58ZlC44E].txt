 I will be king. You will be queen. Another, drive them away. We can be there just for one day. We can be heroes just for one day. You, you can be me. And I, I'll drink all the time. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. We're lovers, we're heroes together. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. I, I wish you could swim. Like the dolphins, like the dolphins can swim. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. Cause we're lovers, and I need your love, man. We're heroes, just one day. I remember standing by the wall. Because, shot up a violence. And we kissed, so nothing could fall. And we changed, from the other side. We can be better, forever and ever. And we can be heroes, just one day. Just one day. Just one day. Just one day. We can be heroes, we can be heroes. We can be heroes. We can be heroes. you
