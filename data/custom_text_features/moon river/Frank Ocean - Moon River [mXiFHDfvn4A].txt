 One, two. Oh, river, wider than a mile, I'm crossing you in style. Someday, day, day, hey, hey, hey. But you're my maker, my heartbreaker. Wherever you're going, I'm going that way. To drift us off to see the world, there's such a crazy world to see. We're all chasing after all the same, chasing after all the same. One, two, river, wider than a mile, crossing in style. Someday, my jeer maker. Wherever you're going, I'm going the same. To drift us off to see the world, there's such a crazy world to see. We're all chasing after all the same, chasing after all the same. But life's just around the bend, my friends, one, river and beach. We're all chasing after all the same, chasing after all the same. Thanks for watching! Thank you.
