 Moon River, wider than a mile, I'm crossing you in style. Someday, oh dream maker, you heartbreaker, wherever you're going, I'm going your way. Two drifters off to see the world, there's such a lot of world to see. We're after the same rainbows and waiting round the bend, my Huckleberry friend, Moon River and me.
