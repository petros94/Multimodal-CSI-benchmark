 I'm truly, truly grateful and terribly happy. Blue River, wider than a mile, I'm crossing you in style someday. Old dream maker, you heartbreaker, wherever you're going, I'm going your way. To drifters, all to see the world, there's such a lot of world to see. Whereafter, the same rainbows end, waiting on the bend. Mahaclbury friend, more river and me. I'm your friend, I'm your friend. I'm your friend, I'm your friend. I'm your friend, I'm your friend. I'm your friend, I'm your friend. Blue River, wider than a mile, I'm crossing you in style someday.
