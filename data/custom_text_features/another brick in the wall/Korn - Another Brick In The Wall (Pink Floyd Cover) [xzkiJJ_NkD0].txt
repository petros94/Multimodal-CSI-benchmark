 Daddy's flown across the ocean. Leaving just a memory. A snapshot in the family album. Daddy, what else did you leave for me? Daddy, what you leave behind for me? All in all it was just a brick in the wall. We don't need no education. We don't need no uncontrolled. No dark circles in the classroom. Just lay down kids alone. Hey, teachers, lay back kids alone. All in all it's just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. We don't need no education. We don't need no uncontrolled. No dark circles in the classroom. Teachers, lay back kids alone. Hey, teachers, lay back kids alone. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. I don't need no arms around me. I don't need no trunks to come in. I have seen the writing on the wall. I don't think I need anything at all. No, don't think I need anything at all. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. All in all it was just a, not a brick in the wall. Goodbye cruel world, I'm leaving you today. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye all you people, there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind. Goodbye. Thank you.
