 Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me? Hey you, standing in the ice with which you feed and fading smiles, can you feel me? Hey you, don't help them to bury the light, don't give in without a fight Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me? Hey you, with your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me? Hey you, will you help me to carry this down? Open your eyes, I'm coming home Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me? Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me? Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me? But it was only fantasy, the world was too high as you can see, no matter how we tried it could not break free And the world's leading to its reign Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me? Hey you, out there on the road, always doing what you're told, can you help me? Hey you, out there beyond the world, breaking bottles in our home, can you help me? Hey you, don't tell me that's not how it all, together we stand, divided we fall Hey you, out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?
