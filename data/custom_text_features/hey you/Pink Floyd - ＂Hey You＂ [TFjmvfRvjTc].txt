 music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. Hey you, out there in the cold Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me? Hey you, standing in the aisles With itchy feet and fainting smiles, can you feel me? Hey you, don't help them to bury the lies Don't give in without a fight music plays. Hey you, out there on your own Sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me? Hey you, with your ear against the wall Waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me? Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone? Open your heart, I'm coming home. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays. music plays.
