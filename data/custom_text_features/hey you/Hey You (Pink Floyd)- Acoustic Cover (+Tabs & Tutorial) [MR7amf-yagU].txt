 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Hey you, out around the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me? Hey you, standing in the ass of which you feel and fading smiles, can you feel me? Hey you, don't help them to bury the lies. Don't give in without a fight. Hey you, out around the wrong, sick naked by the phone, would you touch me? Hey you, with your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me? Hey you, will you help me to carry the stone? Open your heart, I'm coming home. Music playing. Music playing. It was only a fantasy, the world was too high as you can see, no matter how we tried, we could not break free, and the worms ate into his brain. Music playing. Hey you, out around the wrong, always doing what you talk, can you help me? Hey you, out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hole, can you help me? Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all. Together we stand, divided we fall. Thank you.
