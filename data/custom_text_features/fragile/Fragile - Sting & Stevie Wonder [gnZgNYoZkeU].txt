 I love this song. Blood won't flow, and flesh is still long one. Drying in the color of the evening sun, tomorrow's rain for watchers stay in the way, but something in our minds will always stay. Perhaps this final act was meant to cleanse a lifetime's argument, but nothing comes in violence and nothing ever good. For all those born beneath the name restart, let's we forget how fragile we are. On and on the rain will fall, the light tears from the sky, the light tears from the sky, on and on the rain will say, how fragile we are, how fragile we are. The rain will fall, the light tears from the sky, on and on the rain will say, how fragile we are. On and on the rain will fall, the light tears from the sky, the light tears from the sky, on and on the rain will say, how fragile we are. On and on the rain will say, how fragile we are, how fragile we are. On and on the rain will fall, the light tears from the sky, the light tears from the sky, on and on the rain will say, how fragile we are. How fragile we are, how fragile we are. How fragile we are, how fragile we are. This is Stevie Wonder. Thank you.
