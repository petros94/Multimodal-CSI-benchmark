 I would say I'm sorry if I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time I have said too much, been too unkind I try to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies I try to laugh about it, hide in the tears in my eyes Cause boys don't cry, boys don't cry I would break down at your feet and beg forgiveness, plead with you But I know that it's too late and now there's nothing I can do So I try to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies I try to laugh about it, hide in the tears in my eyes Cause boys don't cry, boys don't cry I would tell you that I love you if I thought that you'd stay But I know that it's no use that you've already gone away Misjudged your limits, pushed you too far, took you for granted I thought that you needed me more, I wouldn't do most anything to get you back by my side But I just keep on laughing, hiding the tears in my eyes Boys don't cry, boys don't cry Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Boys don't cry, boys don't cry Transcribed by ESO, translated by â€”
