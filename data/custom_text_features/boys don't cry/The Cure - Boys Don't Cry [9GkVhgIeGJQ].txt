 I'm sorry if I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time I have said to him I've spit to unkind I try to laugh about it Covering all of my lies I try to laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes Boys, don't cry Boys, don't cry I'll break down, I'll drop me and beg forgiveness, please with you But I know that it's too late And now there's nothing I can do So I try to laugh about it Covering all of my lies I try to laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes Boys, don't cry Boys, don't cry I would tell you that I'd love to If I thought that you would stay But I know that it's no use that you already got away If this does your limit, I'll push you to fall And to keep a granted I thought that you needed me more I would do most of anything to get you back by my side But I just keep on laughing Hiding the tears in my eyes Boys, don't cry Boys, don't cry Boys, don't cry Boys, don't cry I'll break down, I'll drop me and beg forgiveness, please with you
