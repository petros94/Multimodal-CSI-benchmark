 I would say I'm sorry if I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time I have said too much, bent too unkind I try to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies I try to laugh about it, hide in the tears in my eyes Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry I would break down at your feet and beg forgiveness, plead with you But I know that it's too late and now there's nothing I can do So I try to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies I try to laugh about it, hide in the tears in my eyes Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry I would tell you that I loved you if I thought that you would stay But I know that it's no use that you've already gone away Miss George, your limit pushed you too far I took you for granted I thought that you needed me more, more, more, now I would do most anything to get you back by my side But I just keep on laughing, hiding the tears in my eyes Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry Boys don't cry Boys don't cry Boys don't cry Boys don't cry Boys don't cry you you
