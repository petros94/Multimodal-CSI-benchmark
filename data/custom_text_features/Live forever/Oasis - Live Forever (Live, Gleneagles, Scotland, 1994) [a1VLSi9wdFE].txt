Maybe I just want to fly, wanna live, but I don't want to die. Maybe I just want to breathe, maybe I just don't believe. Maybe you're the same as me, we see things I'll never see. And I hope forever.

Maybe I will never be all the things that I want to be. Now is not the time to cry, now's the time to find out why. I think you're the same as me, take two sugars in the tea. Take two and I will forever. Forever. Maybe I don't really want to know how you got in close because I just want to fly. Lately, did you ever feel the pain?
