 Maybe I don't really wanna know How you got in grows, cause I just wanna fly, lately. Did you ever feel the pain In the morning rain, I just sold you to the bone. Maybe I just wanna fly, wanna live or don't wanna die. Maybe I just wanna breathe, maybe I just don't believe. Maybe all the same as me, when you see things I'll never see. You and I don't live for ocean. I said maybe I don't really wanna know How you got in grows, cause I just wanna fly, lately. Did you ever feel the pain In the morning rain, I just sold you to the bone. Maybe I will never be All the things that I wanna be. Now it's not the time to cry, not the time to find out why. I think you're the same as me, when you see things I'll never see. You and I don't live for ocean. I said maybe I don't really wanna know How you got in grows, cause I just wanna fly, lately. Did you ever feel the pain In the morning rain, I just sold you to the bone. Music playing. Maybe I don't really wanna know How you got in grows, cause I just wanna fly, lately. Did you ever feel the pain In the morning rain, I just sold you to the bone. Maybe I just wanna fly, wanna live, but I wanna die. Maybe I just wanna breathe, maybe I just can't believe. Maybe you're the same as me, when you see things I'll never see. You and I don't live for ocean. You gotta live for ocean. Music playing. Music playing.
