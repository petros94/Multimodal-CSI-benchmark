 Music playing. Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water. And I think of all the things of what you're doing. And in my head I paint a picture. Since I've come on home while my body's been in it. I miss your gentle hair and the way you like to dress. Why don't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me. Why don't you come on over by the rain. By the rain. By the rain. By the rain. Did you have to go to jail, put your house above your cell. Did you get a good lawyer? I hope you didn't catch a tan. Hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for you. And are you shopping anywhere? Change the color of your hair. Are you busy? Did you have to pay the fine? You were dying the whole time. Are you still dizzy? Since I've come on home while my body's been in it. Since I've missed your gentle hair and the way you like to dress. Why don't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me. Why don't you come on over by the rain. By the rain. By the rain. By the rain. Sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water. And I think of all the things to what you're doing. And in my head I paint a picture. Since I've come on home while my body's been in it. Since I've missed your gentle hair and the way you like to dress. Why don't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me. Why don't you come on over by the rain. By the rain. By the rain. By the rain. By the rain. By the rain. By the rain. By the rain. Why don't you come on over by the rain. you you
