 I hurt myself today. To see if I still feel right. Focus on the pain. The only thing that's real. The need of tears are whole. The old familiar sting. Try to kill it all away. But I remember everything. What have I become? What have I become? My sweetest friend. Everyone I know. Goes away in the end. You could have it all. My empire of darts. I will let you down. I will make you hurt. I wear this crown of shit. Upon my life's chair. Full of broken thoughts. I cannot repair. Beneath the stains of time. The feelings disappear. You are someone else. I am still right here. What have I become? My sweetest friend. Everyone I know. Goes away in the end. You could have it all. My empire of darts. I will let you down. I will make you hurt. If I could start again. A million miles away. I would keep myself. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down. I will let you down.
