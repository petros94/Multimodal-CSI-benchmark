 I heard myself today To see if I'm still free I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears of hope The old familiar sting Trying to kill it all the way But I remember everything What have I become My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end And you can have it all My empire of dust I will let you down I will make you out I wear this crown of thorns Upon my lyre's chair Full of broken thoughts That I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feeling disappeared You were someone else But I am still right here What have I become My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end And you can have it all My empire of dust I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I will keep myself I will find a way I will find a way to find a way
