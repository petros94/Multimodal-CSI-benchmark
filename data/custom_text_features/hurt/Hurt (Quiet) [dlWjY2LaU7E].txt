 I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real The needle tears the whole life, the old familiar stigma Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything What have I become? What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end You could have it all, my empire of darts I will let you down, I will make you hurt I wear this crown of shit upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts, I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time, the feelings disappear You are someone else, I am still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end You could have it all, my empire of darts I will let you down, I will make you hurt If I could start again, a million miles away I would keep myself away from you I will let you down, I will make you hurt I will let you down, I will make you hurt I will let you down, I will make you hurt
