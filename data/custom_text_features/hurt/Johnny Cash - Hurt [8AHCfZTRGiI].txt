 I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real The needle tears the hole, the old familiar stain Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend, everyone I know goes away In the end, and you could have it all My empire of dirt, I will let you down I will make you hurt You stay the hell away from me, you hear I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts, I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time, the feelings disappear You are someone else, I am still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend, everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt, I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again, a million miles away I would keep myself, I would find a way Transcribed by ESO, translated by â€”
