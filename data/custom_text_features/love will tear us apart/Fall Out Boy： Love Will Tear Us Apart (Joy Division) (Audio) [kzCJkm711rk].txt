 When routine bites hard and ambition's low And resentment rides high But emotion won't grow And we're changing our ways Taking different roles Love, love will tear us apart again Why is this bedroom so cold Turned away on your side Is my timing that flawed Our respect run so dry Yet there's still this appeal That we've kept through our lives Love, love will tear us apart again Do you cry out in your sleep All my feelings expose Get a taste in my mouth As desperation takes hold Is it something so good Just can't function no more Love, love will tear us apart again Love, love will tear us apart again Love, love will tear us apart again
