 I'm going to the beach. I'm going to the beach. When routine bites hard, and ambitions are low, resentment right high, and emotions won't grow. We're changing our ways, taking different roads. Love, love which here is upon again. Why is the bedroom so cold? You turn away on your side. Is my time enough, Lord? Or is spectrum so dry? Yet they still disappear, though you've kept your heart alive. Love, love which here is upon again. You cry out your sleep, all my faiths explode. There's a taste in my mouth, this desperation's expelled. How can something so good, just don't function no more? Love, love which here is upon again. Love, love which here is upon again.
