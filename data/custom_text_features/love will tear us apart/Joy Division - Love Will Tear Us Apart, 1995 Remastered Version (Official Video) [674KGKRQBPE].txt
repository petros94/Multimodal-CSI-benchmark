 Music playing. When hurt is by its heart and our visions are alone And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow And we're changing our ways, taking different flows Love, love the terror of the heart again Music playing. Why is a bedroom so cold, turned away on your side? Is my timing that flawed, our respect run so dry? Yet there still is a feeling that we've kept everyone alive Love, love the terror of the heart again Music playing. You cry out in your sleep, and all my feelings expose Yet the taste in my mouth, is desperation that takes hold Just it's something so good, just can't push it no more Love, love the terror of the heart again Music playing. Music playing.
