 I am a man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my day I bid farewell to old Kentucky A place where I was born and bred Four horned six long years I've been in trouble No pressure here on earth I found Four horned in this world, a world I'm bound to ramble I have no friends to help me now He has no friends to help me now Let's farewell my old true lover I never expect to see you again Four horned I'm bound to ride High that northern railroad Perhaps I'll die upon this train Perhaps you'll die upon this train You can bury me in some deep valley For many years rare I made a vow Well then you may learn To learn to love another While I am sleeping in my grave While he is sleeping in his grave Maybe your friends think You can't be just a stranger I face you never will see no more But there is one promise that is given I'll meet you on God's golden shore He'll meet you on God's golden shore Let's stand to Minsky Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you. Thank you.
