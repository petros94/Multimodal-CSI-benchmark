 In constant sorrow, in constant pain, I am the man of constant sorrow. I've seen trouble all my day. I'm a bit farewell to old Kentucky, the place where I was born in pain, the place where he was born in pain. For six long years I've been in trouble, no pleasure here on earth I find. For when this world I bound to crumble, I had no friends to help me have. He has no friends to help me now. I can't spare thee when I fill my old lover, I never expect to see you again. Before I'm bound to ride that northern railroad, perhaps I'll die upon a train. Perhaps you'll die on this train. You can bury me in sunny valley for many years where I may play. Then you may learn to love another while I am sleeping in my grave, while he is sleeping in his grave. Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger. I think you never see no more. But there is one promise that is given. I'll meet you on God's golden shore. Thank you.
