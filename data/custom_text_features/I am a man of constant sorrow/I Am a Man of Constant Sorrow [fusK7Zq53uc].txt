 Music In Constance Oro, through His days I am a man of Constance Oro I've seen the world of my days I've been farewell to all Kentucky The place where I was born and raised The place where He was born and raised Music For six long years I've been in trouble No pleasure here on earth I found For in this world I'm bound to ramble I have no friend to help Him now He has no friends to help Him now Music Oh, these women, my pain, my shame, my brother They're all over the place, they're all in my arms Oh, they're all over the place, they're all in my arms Bab Jean-Blier, they're all waiting for me Bab Jean-Blier, they're all waiting for me Music In the morning, I'm alone I'm in the middle of the night Auma kuma jabale fi chidumya Sir, manjya tiki takunala Hai na to tunu ki se Man man gaye debte tumadela se Man man gaye debte tumadela se Man man gaye debte tumadela se Man man gaye debte tumadela se Man man gaye debte tumadela se Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger But since you never have seen no more Oh, there is one promise that is given I'll meet you on God's golden show He'll meet you on God's golden show Thank you for watching!
