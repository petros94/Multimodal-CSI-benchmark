 I am a man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble on my day So I bid farewell to you, my old Kentucky, the place where I was born and raised Six long years, oh I've been in trouble, no pleasures here, all that I found Or in this world, yeah, I'm bound to Ramble, I have no friends to help me now And no friends to help you now, so it's farewell to you, my old true lover I never expect to see you again, I'm bound to ride that northern railroad Perhaps I'll die upon this train, perhaps he'll die upon this train Pink and Grey Blue, The Blue White Black Black Blue, The Blue And you can bury me in some deep valley When there is where I may lay You may lie for too long and never While I am asleep, then in my grave Maybe your friends will think that I'm just a stranger My face you left, but we'll see again But there is one promise that is given I'll meet you once, God's calling sure I'll meet you once, God's calling sure And comes inside, the world on my feet, comes inside, the world on my feet And comes inside, the world on my feet, comes inside, the world on my feet And comes inside, the world on my feet, comes inside, the world on my feet you Thank you.
