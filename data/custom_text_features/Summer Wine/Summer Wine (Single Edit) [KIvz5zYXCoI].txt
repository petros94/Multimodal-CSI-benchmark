 Strobe-erries, cherries and an angel's kissin' spring My summer wine is really made from all these things I walked in town on silversperes that jingle too The song that I had only sang to just a few She saw my silversperes and said let's pass some time That I will give to you summer wine Oh, summer wine Strobe-erries, cherries and an angel's kissin' spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your silversperes and help me pass the time And I will give to you summer wine Oh, summer wine My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet She reassured me with a unfamiliar line And then she gave to me more summer wine Oh, summer wine Strobe-erries, cherries and an angel's kissin' spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your silversperes and help me pass the time And I will give to you summer wine Oh, summer wine When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes My silversperes wiggled my head filled twice the size She took my silversperes a dollar and a dime And left me craving for more summer wine Oh, summer wine Strobe-erries, cherries and an angel's kissin' spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your silversperes and help me pass the time And I will give to you summer wine Oh, summer wine you you
