 Strawberry's cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things. I walked in town on silver spurs that jingle too A song that I had only sang to just a few She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time And I will give to you summer wine Oh, summer wine Strawberry's cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time And I will give to you summer wine Mmm, summer wine My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet She reassured me with an unfamiliar line And then she gave to me more summer wine Mmm, summer wine Strawberry's cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time And I will give to you summer wine Mmm, summer wine When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size She took my silver spurs and doll around the time And left me craving for more summer wine Oh, summer wine Strawberry's cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time And I will give to you summer wine Mmm, summer wine Mmm, summer wine Mmm, summer wine Oh, summer wine Yeah When my love, when we're not in the past, there's nothing to see Good morning, honey, what's new? Stop talking, stop you
