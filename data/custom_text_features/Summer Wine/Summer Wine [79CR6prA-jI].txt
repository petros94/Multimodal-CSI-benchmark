 Strawberry, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things I walk in town on Silver Spurs the Jigotu A song that I had only singed to just a few She saw my Silver Spurs and said let's pass some time And I will give to you Summer wine Ooh, summer wine Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your Silver Spurs and help me pass the time And I will give to you Summer wine Ooh, summer wine My eyes grew heavy and my lipstick could not speak I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet She reassured me with an unfamiliar line And then she gave to me Ooh, summer wine Ooh, summer wine Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your Silver Spurs and help me pass the time And I will give to you Summer wine Ooh, summer wine When I look up the sun, more shining in my eyes My Silver Spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size She took my Silver Spurs, a dollar and a dime And left me craving for more summer wine Ooh, summer wine Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring My summer wine is really made from all these things Take off your Silver Spurs and help me pass the time And I will give to you Summer wine Thank you. Thank you.
