 Oh what they think about you, better leave my body when the timing comes through, loving on you when the timing comes through. Why you always need to break bread about the way that you would feel if never said jokes on you when the timing comes through. If she had to choose me or her mom, I know I wouldn't last long, yeah, problem with the truth. But when she made me laugh, dut dut dut, alright, take my tune, love it, it's not hard to be replaced, but that feels like, what the fuck is real, what the fuck is wrong, I think I can fit with your tone like, oh what they think about you, better leave my body when the timing comes through, loving on you when the timing comes through. Why you always need to break bread about the way that you would feel if never said jokes on you when the timing comes through, timing comes through, timing comes through. You know I want to be everything that you need, but I'm starting to see. You know I want to be above everything, but I'm just not there yet. Thank you.
