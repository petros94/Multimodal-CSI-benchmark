 Hold a thing about you Hold a thing about you Forgetting me, my body when the time it comes through Loving on YouTube when time it comes through You always need to break quick Pick up all the way that you would be Look up a set, jokes on you It's time they come through Well if she had the truth It's me or her mom I know I wouldn't last long Yeah, no problem with the truth Then she made me laugh Don't do right through my tone But don't have to be in a place where life is easier What the fuck is wrong? What the fuck is wrong? I think I can be with you With you told Hold a thing about you Forgetting me, my body when the time it comes through Loving on YouTube when time it comes through Well you always need to break quick Pick up all the way that you would be Look up a set, jokes on you It's time they come through Time they come through Time they come through Time they come through You know I wanna be Everything that you need What I'm starting to see You know I wanna be Above everything But I'm just not there yet All right. Oh, great.
