 Oh, what they think about you Prepare to leave my body with the time it comes through Loving on you till the time it comes through Why you always hate to break bread Think about the way that you were here Never said jokes on you till the time it comes through Well, if she had to choose me or mom I know I waited us long, yeah No problem with the truth And when she made me laugh, don't know what I do A love is not hard to be in a place where life is easy like What the fuck is real? What the fuck is wrong? I think I could fit with your tone Like, oh, what they think about you Prepare to leave my body with the time it comes through Loving on you till the time it comes through Why you always hate to break bread Think about the way that you were here Never said jokes on you till the time it comes through Time to come through Time to come through You know I wanna be Everything that you need But I'm starting to see You know I wanna be Above everything But I'm just not there yet You know I wanna be Bye. Thank you.
