 Baby can't you see I'm calling A guy like you should wear a warning It's dangerous, I'm falling There's no escape, I can't fade I need a hit, baby get me in It's dangerous, I'm loving Too high, can't come down Who's in my hands in a round and round To you Who's that taste of the lips I'm on a ride Your toxic gun slipping on the floor Taste of a poison paradise I'm a dear tattoo, don't you know that you're toxic I'm a dear tattoo, don't you know that you're toxic I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic Miss Giddler, I had to give you up I took a sip from my devil's cup So lonely, it's taking over me Too high, can't come down It's in the air and it's all around Can you see me? Who's that taste of the lips I'm on a ride Your toxic gun slipping on the floor Taste of a poison paradise I'm a dear tattoo, don't you know that you're toxic I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic Don't you know that you're toxic Taste of a poison paradise Your toxic gun slipping on the floor Taste of a poison paradise I'm a dear tattoo, don't you know that you're toxic Taste of a poison paradise Your toxic gun slipping on the floor Taste of a poison paradise I'm a dear tattoo, don't you know that you're toxic In toxic, keep me down, with your love and now I think I'm ready now I think I'm ready In toxic, keep me down, with your love and now I think I'm ready now
