 Music playing. Music playing. Baby can't you see I'm calling I got like usual warning It's dangerous I'm falling Music playing. There's no escape I can't wait I need a hand Baby give me a hand It's dangerous I'm rubbing it Music playing. Too high you can't come no You think my head's been run out Do you feel me now? Music playing. Oh the days of your lips I'm gonna lay Your dark city comes looking under The days of your boys I've ever dated I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic Music playing. And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic Music playing. It's getting late to give you up I took a sip from my devil's cup Slowly it's taking over me Music playing. Too high you can't come no It's in the air and it's all alone Music playing. Can you feel me now? Music playing. Oh the days of your lips I'm gonna lay Your dark city comes looking under The days of your boys I've ever dated I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic Music playing. And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic Music playing. Don't you know that you're toxic Music playing. Oh the days of your lips I'm gonna lay Your dark city comes looking under The days of your boys I've ever dated I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic Music playing. Your dark city comes looking under The days of your boys I've ever dated I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic And toxic gave me now We can love it now I think I'm ready now I think I'm ready now And toxic gave me now We can love it now I think I'm ready now.
