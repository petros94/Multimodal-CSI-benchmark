 Baby can't you see I'm calling I got like you, sure we're a one in It's dangerous, I'm falling There's no escape, I can't wait I need a hit, baby give me it You're dangerous, I'm loving it Too high, can't calm down Losing my head, it's been around and around Do you feel me now? With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slipping under Taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? Oh, and I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic? It's getting late to give you up I took a sip from my double cup Slowly it's taking over me Too high, can't calm down It's in the air and it's all around Can you feel me now? With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slipping under Taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? Oh, and I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic? Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slipping under Taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? you you you you
