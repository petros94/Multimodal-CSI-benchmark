 When the night has come, and the land is dark, and the moon is the only light we'll see. No, I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid just as long as you stand, stand by me. So darling, darling stand by me, oh stand by me, oh stand by me, stand by me. If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall, or the mountains should crumble to the sea. I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear just as long as you stand, stand by me. And darling, darling stand by me, oh stand by me, oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me. And darling, darling stand by me, oh stand by me, stand by me. And darling, darling stand by me, oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me. Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me, oh stand by me, stand by me.
