 When the night has gone And the land is dark When the moon is the only light we'll see No, I won't be afraid No, I won't be afraid Just as long as you stand Stand by me Oh darling, darling Stand by me Oh, stand by me Oh, stand, stand by me If the sky that we look upon Should tumble and fall Or the mountain should control to the sea I won't cry, I won't cry No, I won't shed a tear Just as long as you stand Stand by me So darling, darling Stand by me Oh, stand by me Oh, stand by me Whenever you're in trouble Won't you stand by me Oh, stand by me Oh, stand now Stand by me Stand by me Translated by Releska
