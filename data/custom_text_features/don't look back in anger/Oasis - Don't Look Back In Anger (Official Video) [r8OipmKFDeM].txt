 Music Slip inside the eye of your mind Don't you know you might find A better place to play You said that you'd never be But all the things that you've seen Slowly fade away So I start a revolution from my back Cause you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside, summertime's in me I stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from up your face You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait She knows it's too late As we're walking on by Her soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say Take me to the place where you go Where nobody knows If it's not our day Please don't put your life in the hands Of a rock and roll band We'll throw it all away I'm gonna start a revolution from my back Cause you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside, cause summertime's in me Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from up your face Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait She knows it's too late As we're walking on by My soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say Take me to the place where you go Where nobody knows If it's not our day Please don't put your life in the hands Of a rock and roll band We'll throw it all away I'm gonna start a revolution from my back Take that look from up your face Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait She knows it's too late As we're walking on by My soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say So Sally can wait She knows it's too late As we're walking on by My soul slides away But don't look back in anger Don't look back in anger I heard you say At least not it's your day Thank you for watching!
