 Music playing... Sleep inside the eye of your mind, don't you know you're not fine, a better place to play. You said that you'd never be, all the things that you see, slowly fade away. So I start revolution from my bed, cause you said the brain went to my head. Step outside these summer times in the room, stand right beside the fire place, take that love from out your face, cause you ain't never gonna burn my heart out. So delicate way, she knows it's too late as she's walking all by. My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger, I heard you say. Music playing... Take me to a place where you go, where nobody knows if it's never dead. Please don't put your up in the head, I feel like you're going to end, throw it all away.
