 You said that you'd never been But all the things that should be Slipped inside the eye of your mind Don't you know you might find a better place to play You said that you'd never been But all the things that you've seen Were slowly fading away So we saw the revolution from my back Cause you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside to some of the times in Rome Set up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out And so Sally can wait She knows it's too late As we're walking on by Her soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say Take me to the place where you go Where nobody knows if it's night or day But please don't put your life in the hands Of a rock and roll band Throw it all away You're gonna start a revolution from my back Cause you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside to some of the times in Rome Set up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out And so Sally can wait She knows it's too late As we're walking on by My soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say Music playing Music playing So Sally can wait She knows it's too late As we're walking on by Her soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say So Sally can wait She knows it's too late As she's walking on by My soul slides away But don't look back in anger Don't look back in anger I heard you say At least not today At least not today At least not today
