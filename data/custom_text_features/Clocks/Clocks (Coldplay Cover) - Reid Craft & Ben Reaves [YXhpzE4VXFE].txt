 Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Right school out and I can't be saved. Tides that I tried to swim against. That brought me down upon my knees. Oh I beg, I beg and plead singing. Come out of things I'm said. Shoot it out, pull off my head. And I'm troubled that can't be named. Tigers waiting to be tame singing. Music playing. Confusion never stops. Clothes and walls and ticking clocks. Gonna come back and take you home. I could not stop the tune I'm on singing. Come out upon my seas. Cursed mist opportunities. Am I a part of the cure? Am I a part of the disease singing? Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Music playing. Home where I wanted to go. Home where I wanted to go. Home where I wanted to go. Home where I wanted to go. Music playing. Thank you.
