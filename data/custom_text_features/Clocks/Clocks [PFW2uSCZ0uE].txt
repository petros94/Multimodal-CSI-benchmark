 Music playing. Let's go out and I can't be saved. Tired, said I tried to swim against. I've pulled me down, I pulled my knees. Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing. Come out of things I'm said. Shoot an apple off my head. And I trouble the camping name. A tiger's waiting to be tamed. I'm singing. Music playing. Confusion never stops. Closing walls and ticking clocks. Gonna come back and take you home. I could not stop but you now know I'm singing. Come out upon my scenes. Curse me and stop but you know these. Am I a part of the cure? Am I part of the dizzy singing? You are. You are. You are. You are. You are. Music playing. Nothing else compares. Nothing else compares. Nothing else compares. Music playing. You are. You are. You are. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go. Home, home, where I wanted to go.
