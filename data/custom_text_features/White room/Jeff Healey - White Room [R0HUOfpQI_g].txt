 In a white room with black curtains, the other station Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired stallings Silver horses, ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes Don't ask why, on your evening, my contentment I'm waiting this place where the sun never shines Waiting this place where the shadows run from themselves You said no strings could secure you at the station Black-wound tickets, restless diesels, goodbye window I wanted you, such a sad time at the station As I walked out, bent my own knee, just beginning I'm waiting again when the trains call by, lie with you Where the shadows run from themselves I'm waiting again when the trains call by, lie with you After party, she was kindness in the hot crowd Consolation for the old, now forgotten Yellow taggers, crouched in jungles in her dark eyes She's just testing goodbye windows, tired stallings I'm sleeping this place with the lonely crowd I'm lying in the dark where the shadows run from themselves No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no I'm lying in the dark where the shadows run from themselves Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, whoa oh umbrella I'm just waiting for you Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I like this one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
