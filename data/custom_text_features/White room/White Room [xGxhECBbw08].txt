 In the white room with black curtains near the station Black roof country, no gold payments, tired starlings Silver horses, round down moonmeat in your dark eyes Don't like smile on you leaving my contentment I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines I'll wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves You said no strings could secure you at the station Back from taking restless diesel goodbye windows I walked into such a sad time at the station As I walked out felt my own need just beginning I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back I'll wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves At the party she was kindness in the heart crown Consolation for the old blue now forgotten Yellow tigers, crouched in jungles in her dark eyes She's just pressing, good bye windows, tired starling I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowds Lying in the dark where the shadows run from themselves You said no strings could secure you at the station You said no strings could secure you at the station You said no strings could secure you at the station You said no strings could secure you at the station You said no strings could secure you at the station Thank you.
