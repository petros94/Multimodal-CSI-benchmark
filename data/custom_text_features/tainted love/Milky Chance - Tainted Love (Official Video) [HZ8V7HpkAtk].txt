 Well sometimes I feel I've got to Round the way I've got to Get away from the pain You dive into the heart of me The love we share seems to go nowhere And I lost my light For I toss and turn I can't see bad night Once I ran to you Now I run from you This chain of love you've given I give you all of my cure Give you, take my tears And that's not giving up Chain of love Now I know I've got to Round the way I've got to Get away You don't really want anymore from me to me Things are, you need so much to hold you tight And you think, love's too afraid But I'm sorry I don't fade that way Once I ran to you Now I run from you This chain of love you've given I give you all of my cure Give you, take my tears And that's not giving up Chain of love Chain of love Chain of love Don't touch me please I can't understand the way you tease I love you though you hurt me so Now I'm gonna pack my things And go, and go, and go you Thank you.
