 Sometimes I feel I've got to run away, I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me The love we share seems to go hand-over-way, and I've lost my light For I toss and turn, I can sleep at night, once I run to you Now I run from you, this tainted love you've given I give you all the boy could give you, take my tins and that's not nearly all Tainted love, have you tainted love? Now I know I've got to run away, I've got to get away You don't really want anymore from me to make things right, you need someone to hold you tight And you think I is too great, but I'm sorry I don't pray that way Once I ran to you, now I run from you, this tainted love you've given I give you all the boy could give you, take my tins and that's not nearly all Tainted love, have you tainted love? Don't touch me please, I cannot stand the way you do I love you though you hurt me so, now I'm gonna pack my things and go Tainted love, tainted love Tainted love, tainted love Don't touch me baby, tainted love Tainted love, tainted love Tainted love, tainted love Tainted love, tainted love Tainted love, tainted love Tainted love, tainted love
