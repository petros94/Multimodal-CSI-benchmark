 The End Sometimes I feel I've got to run away, I've got to get away from the pain that you've brought me In the heart of pain, the love we share seems to go nowhere And I've lost my life, for I've lost it, and I can't sleep at night What's happened to you? I'm telling you, now I'll run from you I'm saying to you, thank you for giving If you want a boy to give you, take my tears and that's not nearly how Take it low, take it low Now I know I've got to run away, I've got to get away You don't really want any more for me to beg, despite You leave someone to hold you tight, and you'll be lost in pain But I'm sorry, I don't breathe that way What's happened to you? I'm telling you, now I'll run from you I'm telling you, thank you for giving If you want a boy to give you, take my tears and that's not nearly how Take it low, take it low Take it low, take it low Take it low, take it low Take it low, take it low Take it low, take it low Oh Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
