 I put a spell on you. Cause you're mine. You better stop the things you do. I ain't lying. No, I ain't lying. You know I can't stand it. You're running around. You know better than it. I can't stand it cause you put me down. Yeah, yeah. I put a spell on you. Because you're mine. You're mine. You're mine. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you anyhow. And I don't care if you don't want me. I'm yours right now. Oh, you hear me? I put a spell on you. You're mine.
