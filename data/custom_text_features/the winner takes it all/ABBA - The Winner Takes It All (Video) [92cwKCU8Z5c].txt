 you you you you you I don't want to talk about things we've gone through though it's hurting me now it's history I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too nothing more to say no more race to play the winner takes it all the loser standing small beside the victory that's a destiny I was in your arms thinking I belong there I figured it makes sense building me a fence building me a home thinking I'd be strong there but I was so fooled laying by the rules the gods make wrong with eyes their minds as cold as eyes and someone way down here loses someone dear the winner takes it all the loser has to fall it's in one it's place why should I complain tell me does she kiss like I used to kiss you does it feel the same when she calls your name somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you but what can I say rules must be obeyed the judges will decide the likes of me combine spectators of the charm always stay in love the game is on again another or a friend a big finger is small the winner takes it all it's in one it's in one I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad and understand you've come to shake my hand I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense no self confidence but you see the winner takes it all the winner takes it all someone dear the winner takes it all the winner takes it all someone dear takes it all it's in one it's in one you Thank you.
