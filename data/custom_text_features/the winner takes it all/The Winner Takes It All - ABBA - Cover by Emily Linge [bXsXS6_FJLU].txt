 I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through Though it's hurting me, now it's history I've played all my cards, and that's what you've done too And nothing more to say, no more race to play The winner takes it all, the loser standing small Beside the victory, that's her destiny I was in your arms, thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense, building me a fence Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool, playing by the rules The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here, loses someone dear The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain? Tell me does she kiss, like I used to kiss you Does it feel the same, when she calls your name Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you But what can I say, rules must be obeyed The judges will decide, the likes of me abide Spectators of the show, always staying low The game is on again, a lover or a friend A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all I don't wanna talk, if it makes you feel sad And I understand, you've come to shake my hand I apologize, if it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence The winner takes it all I don't wanna talk, if it makes you feel bad I don't wanna talk, if it makes you feel bad Thank you.
