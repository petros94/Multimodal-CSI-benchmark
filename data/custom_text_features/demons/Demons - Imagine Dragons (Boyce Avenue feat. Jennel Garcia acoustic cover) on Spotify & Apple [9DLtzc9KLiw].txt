 When the days are cold and the cards are folding The saints we see are all made of gold When your dreams they fill and the ones we hail Are the worst of all in the blood's run stale I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come When you feel my heat, look into my eyes It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Don't get too close, it's dark inside It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide When the curtains call, it's the last of all When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl So they duck your grave in the masquerade We'll come calling out at the next you may Don't wanna let you down, but I am hellbound Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come When you feel my heat, look into my eyes It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Don't get too close, it's dark inside It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go Your eyes they shine so bright, I wanna save their light I can't escape this now, unless you show me how When you feel my heat, look into my eyes It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Don't get too close, it's dark inside It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Thank you.
