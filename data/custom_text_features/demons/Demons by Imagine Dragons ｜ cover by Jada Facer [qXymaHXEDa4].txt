 When the days are cold and the cots are full Then the saints we see are all made of gold When your dreams are failing the ones we hail Are the worst of all and the bloods run stale I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you But with the beasts inside there's no where we can hide No matter what we breed we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come When you feel my heat look into my eyes It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Don't get too close, it's dark inside It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide The curtains call, it's the last of all When the lights fade out all the sinners crawl So they dug your grave and the masquerade Will come calling out at the mess you've made Don't wanna let you down but I am hellbound Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth No matter what we breed we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come When you feel my heat look into my eyes It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Don't get too close, it's dark inside It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide I say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go Your eyes they shine so bright, I wanna save that light I can't escape this now unless you show me how When you feel my heat look into my eyes It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Don't get too close, it's dark inside It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide you you
