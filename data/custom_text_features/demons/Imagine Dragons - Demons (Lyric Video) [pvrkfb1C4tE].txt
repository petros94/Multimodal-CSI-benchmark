 When the days are cold and the cards all fold in the saints We see our armade of gold When your dreams all fail in the wrongs We hail out the worst of all And the blood's run stale I wanna hide the truth I wanna shelter you But with the beast inside There's nowhere we can hide No matter what we breed We still are made of greed This is my kingdom come This is my kingdom come When you pull my heat Look into my eyes It's where my demons hide It's where my demons hide Don't get too close It's dark inside It's where my demons hide It's where my demons hide There is callous last of all When the lights fade out All the sinners crawl So they dug your grave And the masquerade will come calling out at the mesquite Don't wanna let you down But I am hellbound Oh this is all for you Don't wanna hide the truth No matter what we breed We still are made of greed This is my kingdom come This is my kingdom come When you pull my heat Look into my eyes It's where my demons hide It's where my demons hide Don't get too close It's dark inside It's where my demons hide It's where my demons hide They say it's what you make I say it's up to fate It's woven in my soul I need to let you go Your eyes they shine so bright I wanna save that light I can't escape this now Unless you show me how When you pull my heat Look into my eyes It's where my demons hide It's where my demons hide Don't get too close It's dark inside It's where my demons hide It's where my demons hide you Thank you.
