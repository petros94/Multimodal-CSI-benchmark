 WHAAAAAT? The End of the Game. People everywhere. People everywhere. Sense of expectation. Hanging in the air. Gave in out a spark. Crossed the room, your eyes are glowing in the dark. And here we go again. We know the start, we know the end. Masters of the scene. We've done it all before, and now we're back to get some more. You know what I mean. Voo le boo. Take it now and even now is all we got. Nothing promised, no regrets. Voo le boo. Ain't no big deal, you know what to do. Like a stone said, Voo le boo. Voo le boo. I don't watch you think, the girl means business, so I'll offer her a drink. Feeling like some crowd, see you leave your table pushing through the crowd. I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game. Masters of the scene. We've done it all before, and now we're back to get some more. You know what I mean. Voo le boo. Take it now and even now is all we got. Nothing promised, no regrets. Voo le boo. Ain't no big decision, you know what to do. Like a stone said, Voo le boo. I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game. Masters of the scene. We've done it all before, and now we're back to get some more. You know what I mean. Voo le boo. Take it now and even now is all we got. Nothing promised, no regrets. Voo le boo. Ain't no big decision, you know what to do. Like a stone said, Voo le boo. Voo le boo. Voo le boo. Take it now and even now is all we got. Voo le boo. Take it now and even now is all we got. Voo le boo. Take it now and even now is all we got. Voo le boo. Woooow! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Woooow! Wooooow!
