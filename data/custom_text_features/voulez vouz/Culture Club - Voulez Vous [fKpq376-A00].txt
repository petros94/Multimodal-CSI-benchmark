 Music playing. Music playing. People everywhere, a sense of execution laying in their heads. Even now the spark, a cough in your eyes is lovin' in the dark. And here we go again, we know the sound, we know the air. Masters of the sea, we've done it all before and now we're back to get some more. Hey, you know what I mean. Forever, takin' our leave, now is all we get, nothing promised, no regret. Forever, ain't no big decision, you know what to do, like a strong signal. Forever. Forever. I know what you think, the point is business, so I'll offer him a drink. Lookin' at the crowd, I see you leave your table, pushin' through the crowd. I'm really glad you came in, know the rules, you know the game. Masters of the sea, we've done it all before and now we're back to get some more. Hey, you know what I mean. Forever, takin' our leave, now is all we get, nothing promised, no regret. Forever. Ain't no big decision, you know what to do, like a strong signal. And here we go again, we know the stuff, we know the end. Masters of the sea, we've done it all before and now we're back to get some more. Hey, you know what I mean. Forever, takin' our leave, now is all we get, nothing promised, no regret. Forever. Ain't no big decision, you know what to do, like a strong signal. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. You you
