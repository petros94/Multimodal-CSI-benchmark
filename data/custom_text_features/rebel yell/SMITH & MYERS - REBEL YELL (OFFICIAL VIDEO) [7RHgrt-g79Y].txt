 Last night a little dancer came dancing to my door Last night a little angel came pumping across my floor She said come on now, I got a license for love And if it expires, pray help from above In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more With the rebel yell she cried more, more, more In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more With the rebel yell she cried more, more, more, more She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg But when I'm died and lonely, she sees me to the bitter What set you free and brought you to me, babe? What set you free? I need to hear about me, because in the midnight hour She cried more, more, more With the rebel yell she cried more, more, more In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more With the rebel yell she cried more, more, more He lives alone in his own heaven Collects it to go from a 7-eleven He's all out, he's all out to collect a fair Just as long as it don't mess up his hair I walk the wall for you, babe 8,000 miles for you I dry your tears of pain 8 million times for you I sell my soul for you, babe For money to burn for you I give you all and have nothing Just a, just a, to have you hear about me Because in the midnight hour she cried more, more, more With the rebel yell she cried more, more, more In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more With the rebel yell she cried more, more, more, more With the little baby she walked more More, more, more, more With the little angel she walked more More, more, more, more Translated by Releska
