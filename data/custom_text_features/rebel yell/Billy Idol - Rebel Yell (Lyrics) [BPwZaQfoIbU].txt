 Last night, you did a dancer, came dancing to my door. Last night, the little angel came pumping on the floor. She said, it come baby, by the license for love. And if the next target's, pray help from above. Because in the midnight hour, she's from above, above, above. With a rebel yell, she's from above, above, above. And in the midnight hour, they're from above, above. With a rebel yell, from above, above, above. She's gonna not stay here, she won't sit and beg. The world is hard to love when she sees me too big. What set you free, brought you to me babe? What set you free, I leave you here by me? Because in the midnight hour, she's from above, above, above. With a rebel yell, she's from above, above, above. In the midnight hour, they're from above, above, above. With a rebel yell, from above, above. Hey, listen, I'm so happy. The legs, it's a gold bar, I'm a 7-eleven. Well, this time, all night, she's gonna let me keep it. But just along, just along, the gold is up, it's dead. Ah, ah. Ah, ah. Ah, ah. Ah, ah. Ah, ah. I walk the wall for you, babe. A thousand miles for you. I drive your tears up on you. A million times for you. I tell my soul. For money to burn, burn, burn. I'll keep you all, and have no pain. Just a, just a, just a, just a, the happy here by me. Because in the midnight hour, she's from above, above. With a rebel yell, she's from above, above, above. In the midnight hour, babe, above, above, above. With a rebel yell, she's from above, above, above. Above, above, above. Oh, yeah, little baby, she won't hold. Above, above, above, above. Oh, yeah, little angel. She won't hold. Above, above, above, above. Oh, yeah. you
