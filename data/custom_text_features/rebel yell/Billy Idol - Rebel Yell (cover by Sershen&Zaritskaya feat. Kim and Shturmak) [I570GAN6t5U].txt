 The Last Night of Little Dancin' The Last Night of Little Dancin' Last night a little dancer She came dancing to my door Last night a little angel She came pumping across my floor She's had a killing baby I got a license for love And if it inspires I'll pay her from above Because The end of the night now She cried more and more and more When I left for you She cried more and more and more In the midnight hour, babe More and more and more When I left for you More and more and more and more She does it like slavery She won't say that won't they But when I turn alone, babe She sees me no better I said to you free I need you here by me I said, I said to you free I need you here by me Because The end of the night now She cried more and more and more When I left for you She cried more and more and more In the midnight hour, babe More and more and more When I left for you More and more and more and more And there's a woman in his own heaven Connected to go from a seven-eleven Running through the night to collect his death Just so alone, so alone It'll match up his head The End The End The End The End I walk the world with you, babe A thousand miles with you I dried your tears of pain, babe A million times for you I sell my soul for you, babe For money to burn with you I give you all and have no, babe Just so, just so So how do you hear me? Because The End of the Night Now She cried more and more and more With a level of yell She cried more and more and more In the midnight hour, babe More and more and more With a level of yell More and more and more and more Oh, yeah, a little pain, babe She cried more and more and more Oh, yeah, a little red rose she wore More and more and more and more The End The End The End The End
