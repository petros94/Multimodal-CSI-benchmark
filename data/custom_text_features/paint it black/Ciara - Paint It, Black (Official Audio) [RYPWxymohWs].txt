 I see your red door, I see your red door, I see your red door. I want it painted black, no colors anymore, I want them to turn black. I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes, I have to turn my head and to my darkness clothes. I see your light of colors and their own painted black, with flowers and my love both never to come back. I see people turn their heads and wakely look away, like no one baby, it just happens everyday. I look inside myself and see my heart is black, I see my red door, I must have it painted black. Maybe when I fade away and I have to face the things, it's not easy facing up when your whole world is black. No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue, I could not foresee this thing happening to you. If I look hard enough into the sunset, my love will last with me before the morning comes. I see your painted, painted, painted black, black as night, black as cold, see the sun, not the other side. I see your painted, painted, painted black as cold, see the sun, not the other side. I want them to turn black, I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes, I have to turn my head and to my darkness clothes. To my darkness, yeah. To my darkness, yeah. To my darkness, yeah.
