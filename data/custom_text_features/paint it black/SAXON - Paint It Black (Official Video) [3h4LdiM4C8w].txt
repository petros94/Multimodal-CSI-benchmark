 I see a red door and I run to paint your back No colors anymore, I want them to turn back I see the colors walk by, the stings are my clothes I have to turn my head until my darkness goes I see it, I'm at the cause and there are things to grab The travelers and my love were never coming back I see people turn their heads and quickly look away Like a newborn baby it just happens every day I look inside myself and see my heart in black I see my red door and the south it beams in black Maybe then I'll fade away and have to face the facts It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blow I could not foresee this thing happening to you If I look high enough into the sunset My love would not believe before the morning comes I see a red door and I run to paint your back No colors anymore, I want them to turn back I see the colors walk by, the stings are my clothes I have to turn my head until my darkness goes I want to be the place, be the place I want to see the sun, the water from the sky I want to see the paint of the land Oh... Thank you.
