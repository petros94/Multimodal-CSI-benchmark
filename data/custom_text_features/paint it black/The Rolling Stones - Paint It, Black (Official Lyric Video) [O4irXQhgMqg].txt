 I see a red dot as I want it into black No colors anymore, I want them to turn black I see the girls while I dress in their summer clothes I have to turn my head until my darkness goes I see a line of cars on their arc into black With flowers and my love both never to come back I see people turn their heads and quickly look away Like a new born baby it just happens every day I look inside myself and see my heart is black I see my red door I was heading into black Maybe then I fade away as I have to face the fact It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue I could not foresee this thing happening to you If I look hard enough into the setting sun My love will laugh with me before the morning comes I see a red door and I want it painted black No colors anymore, I want them to turn black I see the girls while I dress in their summer clothes I have to turn my head until my darkness goes I want to see a thing that's painted black I want to see the sun, not a drop from the sky I want to see a thing that's painted black I want to see a thing that's painted black I want to see a thing that's painted black I want to see a thing that's painted black I want to see a thing that's painted black I want to see a thing that's painted black Thank you.
