 The things I brought you when I found out you had cancer of the bone. If father cried on the telephone and he drove his car to the Navy yard, just to prove that he was sorry. In the morning in the window shade when the light pressed up against your shoulder blade I could see what you were reading. Oh, the glory that the Lord has made and the complications you could do without when I kissed you on the mouth. Susan Knight at Bible study, we lift our hands and we pray over your body but nothing ever happens. I remember at Michael's house in the living room when you kissed my neck and I almost touched your blouse. In the morning at the top of the stairs when your father found out what we did that night and you told me you were scared. Oh, the glory when you ran outside with your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied and you told me not to follow you. Sunday night when I cleaned the house I found the card where you wrote it out with the pictures of a mother. On the floor at the great divide with my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied I'm crying in the bathroom. In the morning when you finally go and when you're swaxing with your head hung though in the carnal it's the window. In the morning in the window shade on the first of March on the holiday the thought is are you breathing? Oh, the glory that the Lord has made and the complications when I see his face in the morning in the window. Oh, the glory when he took our place but he took my shoulders and he shook my face and he takes and he takes and he takes. Oh, the glory when you ran outside with your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied and you told me not to follow you. Sunday night when I cleaned the house I found the card where you wrote it out with the pictures of a mother. Sunday night when I cleaned the house I found the card where you wrote it out with the pictures of a mother. La le le, la le la junior La le le, la le la junior La le le, la le la junior
