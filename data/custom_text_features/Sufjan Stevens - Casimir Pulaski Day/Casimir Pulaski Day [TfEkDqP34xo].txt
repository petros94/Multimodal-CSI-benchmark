 2, 3, 4... Music Golden rod and the 4H stone The things I brought you when I found out You had cancer off the bone Music Your father cried on the telephone And he drove his car into the Navy Yard Just to prove that he was sorry Music In the morning through the window shade When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade I can see what you are reading Music All the glory that the Lord has made And the complications you could do without When I kissed you on the mouth Music Tuesday night at the Bible study We lift our hands and pray over your body But nothing ever happens Music I remember at Michael's house In the living room when you kissed my neck And I almost touched your house Music In the morning at the top of the stairs When your father found out what we did that night And he told me you were scared Music All the glory when you ran outside With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied And he told me not to follow you Music Music Music Music Music Music Sunday night when I clean the house I find the card where you wrote it out With the pictures of your mother Music On the floor at the great divide With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied I am crying in the bathroom Music In the morning when you finally go And the nurse runs in with her head hung low And the car no longer leads the window Music In the morning in the winter shade On the first of March on the holiday I thought I saw you breathing Music All the glory that the Lord has made And the complications when I see his face In the morning in the window Music All the glory when he took our place But he took my shoulders and he shook my face And he takes, and he takes, and he takes Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music
