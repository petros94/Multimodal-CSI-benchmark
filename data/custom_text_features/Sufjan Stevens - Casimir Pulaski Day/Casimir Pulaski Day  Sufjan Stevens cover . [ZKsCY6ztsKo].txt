 The golden rod and the 4-H stone The things I brought you in I found out you had cancer of the bone. Your father cried on the telephone and he drove his car into the yard just to prove that he was sorry. And in the morning through the window shade when the light pressed up against your shoulder blade I could see what you were reading. And all the glory that the Lord has made and the complications you could do without when I kissed you on the mouth. Tuesday night at the Bible study we lift our hands and pray over your body but nothing ever happened. And I remember at Michael's house in the living room when you kissed my neck and I almost touched your plows. And in the morning at the top of the stairs when your father found out what we did that night and you told me you were scared. And all the glory when you ran outside when you shunned and you shoes and tied and you told me not to follow you. Tuesday night when I cleaned the house I found the card where you wrote it out with the pictures of your mother. And on the floor of the great divide with my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied I am crying in the bathroom. And in the morning when you finally go and the nurse runs in with a head held low and the cardinal hits the window. And in the morning in the winter shade on the first of March on the holiday I thought I saw you breathing. And all the glory that the Lord has made and the complications when I see his face in the morning in the window. And all the glory when he took our place but he took my shoulders and he shook my face and he takes and he takes and he takes. you Thank you.
