 There's a lady who sure All that glitters is gold And she's buying a stairway to heaven When she gets there she knows If the stores are all closed With a word she can get what she came for Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh A stairway to heaven There's a sign on the wall But she wants to be sure Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings In a tree by the brook There's a songbird who sings Sometimes all of our thoughts are mischievous Ah, makes me wonder I wonder I really, really wonder There's a feeling I get When I look to the west And my spirit is crying for leaving In my thoughts I have seen Rings of smoke through the trees And the voices of those who still look in It's whispered, it's smold If we all call the tune Then the piper will lead us to read the run And a new day will dawn For those who stand long And the forest will echo with laughter Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah If there's a bustle in your head Rope the wheel on now It's just a spring queen for the late queen Yes, there are two paths You can go by, but in the long run There's still some time to change the road to Rome Oh, it makes me wonder Your head is humming and it won't go In case you don't know The piper's calling you to join him Oh, can you hear the wind blow And did you know your stairway lies upon the whispered land Stairway to heaven, stairway to heaven You can buy it, you can borrow You've got to walk it straight in that road Stairway to heaven, stairway to heaven Stairway to heaven And as we walk on down the road Our shadows longer than our souls All that clears is my door My door I want to be a rock and not a rock Oh, the great almighty dollar leaves you lonely Lost in love You can't do your step forever You've got a work to get to heaven Stairway to heaven If we listen and hope and hope And hope and hope Every question that we ask The truth will come to us at last And she's buying a stairway to heaven To heaven To heaven To heaven To heaven Thank you. Thank you.
