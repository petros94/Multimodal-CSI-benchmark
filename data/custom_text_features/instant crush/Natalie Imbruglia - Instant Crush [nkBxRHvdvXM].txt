 I didn't want to be the one to forget I thought of everything I'd never regret A little time with you is all that I get That's all I need because it's all we can take You used me once, you fled, looking in with doubt You made enough for four, then you ran off I got a picture of us kids in my head And all I hear is the last thing that you said I listened to your problems, now listen to mine I didn't want you anymore I'm willing to never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen every day Can I count it on you being a friend? Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I'm gonna say But I never really know where to go So I chain myself to a friend Cause I know it and that's like a door I'm willing to never be alone again But I never really know where to go So I chain myself to a friend So no again It didn't matter what they wanted to see He thought he saw someone that looked just like me This summer memory that just never dies We worked too long and had to give it no time But now the love is down, I'm hiding in the cold Taking, I don't wanna sing anymore I listened to your problems, now listen to mine I didn't want you anymore I'm willing to never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen every day Can I count it on you being a friend? Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I'm gonna say But I never really know where to go So I chain myself to a friend Cause I know it and that's like a door I don't understand, don't get upset I'm not the future I'm asking around, it's all I do When I'm with you And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen every day Can I count it on you being a friend? Can I give it up or give it away? I know I thought about what I'm gonna say But I never really know where to go So I chain myself to a friend Cause I know it and that's like a door And we will never be alone again We will never be alone again We will never be alone again Thanks for watching!
