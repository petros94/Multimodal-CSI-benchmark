 you you you you you you you I didn't want to be the one to forget I thought of everything I'd never regret A little time with you is all that I get There's only me because it's all it can take One thing I never see the same when you're around I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground I wanna take you to that place in the rush But no one gives us any time anymore He asked me once if I'd look it on his dog You made it off a fall but then you ran off I got this picture of his kids in my hand And all I hear is the last thing that you said I listened to your problems, now listen to mine I didn't want to anymore Oh And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't ever happen today Kinda killin' what you need to know Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I change myself to a friend Cause I know what it looks like to know And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't ever happen today Kinda killin' what you need to know Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I change myself to a friend So I'm on again It didn't matter what they wanted to see He thought he saw someone that looked just like me There's some memory that just never dies We went too long and hard to give it no time He sees right through me it's so easy with lies Cracks in the road that I would try in disguise He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall He cannot break it down or else he would fall One thousand only stars hiding in the cold Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore Music I listened to your problems, now listen to mine I didn't want to anymore And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen everyday Kinda killin' what you need to know Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I change myself to a friend Cause I know what it helps to know And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen everyday Kinda killin' what you need to know Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I change myself to a friend Cause I know what it helps to know I don't understand Don't get upset that I'm not with you We're swimming around It's all I do We're not with you And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen everyday Kinda killin' what you need to know Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I change myself to a friend Cause I know what it helps to know And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen everyday Kinda killin' what you need to know Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I change myself to a friend Cause I know what it helps to know I change myself to a friend Cause I know what it helps to know I don't understand Don't get upset that I'm not with you We're swimming around It's all I do We're not with you And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen everyday Kinda killin' what you need to know Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say Thank you.
