 I'm done hating myself for feeling I'm done crying myself away I gotta leave and start the healing But when you move like that, I just wanna stay What have I become? Looking through your phone, on love to you is just a game Look what I have done, I'm dialling out the numbers, oh yeah, I don't want my heart to break Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All the change and all that danger I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that fear and all that pressure I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you Love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you Oh no, how did I manage to lose me? I am not this desperate, not this crazy There's no way I'm sticking around to fight on I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself Look what I have done, I'm dialling out the numbers, oh yeah, I don't want my heart to break Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All the change and all that danger I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that fear and all that pressure I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you Love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you Oh no, how did I manage to lose you?
