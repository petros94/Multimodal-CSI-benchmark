 The End. Take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it ships and crack Where secrets lie in the board of fires and the humming-wise, Amen, you know you're never coming back across the square, Across the bridge, across the mills, across the stout All together in the storm comes a toll, handsome man A dusty black coat with a red right hand I'll rub you in his arms, tell you that you've been a good boy He'll rekindle all the dreams that took you a lifetime to destroy He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul But there won't be a single thing that you can do He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a good group There'll whisper in his name through this disappearing land But hidden in his coat is a red right hand You don't owe no money, you'll get you some You don't have no car, you'll get you one You don't have no self-respect, you feel like an insect Well, don't you worry, buddy, cause here he comes Through the ghettos and the barrio and the barrio and the slum His shadow is cast wherever he stands Stacks of green paper in his red right hand He's a good boy, he's a good boy, he's a good boy, he's a good boy He's a good boy, he's a good boy, he's a good boy, he's a good boy, he's a good boy He's a good boy, he's a good boy, he's a good boy, he's a good boy You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams He'll appear out of nowhere, but he ain't what he seems You'll see him in your head on the TV screen, hey buddy, I'm wanting you to turn it off He's a good, he's a god, he's a man, he's a good rude You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plane, designed and directed by his red right hand You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plane, designed and directed by his red right hand
