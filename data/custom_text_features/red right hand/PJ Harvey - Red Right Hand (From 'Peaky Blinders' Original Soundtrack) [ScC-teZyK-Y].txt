 Take a little walk to the edge of time, go across the tracks Where the vodka throbs like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks Where secrets lie in the blood of the forest in the humming warts and you know you're never coming back On a gathering stone comes a toll and some man in a dusty black coat with a red bride-night Where the vodka throbs like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks Where the secrets lie in the blood of the forest in the humming warts and you know you're never coming back On a gathering stone comes a toll and some man in a dusty black coat with a red bride-night Where the vodka throbs like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks Thank you.
