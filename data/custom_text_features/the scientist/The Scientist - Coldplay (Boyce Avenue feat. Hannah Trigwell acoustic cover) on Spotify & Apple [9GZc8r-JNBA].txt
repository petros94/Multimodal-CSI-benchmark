 Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are I had to find you, tell you I need you Tell you I'll set you apart Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions Oh, let's go back to the start Running in circles, coming up tails Heads on a science apart Nobody said it was easy Oh, it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard Don't take me back to the start I was just guessing the numbers and figures Pulling your puzzles apart Questions of science, science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart Tell me you love me and come back and haunt me Oh, when I rush to the start Running in circles, chasing tails Coming back as we are Nobody said it was easy Oh, it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard I'm going back to the start Oh, it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it would be so hard Oh, take me back to the start Oh, take us back to the start Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm going back to the start Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh you
