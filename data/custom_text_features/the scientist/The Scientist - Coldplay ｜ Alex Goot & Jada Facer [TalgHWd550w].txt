 Come up to me to you, tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are I had to find you, tell you I need you Tell you I set you apart Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions Oh, let's go back to the start Running in circles, coming up tales Heads on a science of pie Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard Oh, take me back to the start I was just guessing the numbers and figures Pulling the puzzles apart Questions of science, science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me Oh, and I rush to the start Running in circles, chasing our tales Coming back as we are Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part No one ever said it would be so hard I'm going back to the start I'm going back to the start I'm going back to the start Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Thank you.
