 I heard he sang a good song I heard he had a style And so I came to see him to listen for a while And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes Strumbling by pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly With his song telling my whole life, with his words Killing me softly with his song I felt off-lushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud I agreed that he would finish, but he just kept right on Strumbling by pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly With his song telling my whole life, with his words Killing me softly with his song He sang as if he knew me in all my doctor's space And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there But he was there, this stranger, singing clear and strong Strumbling by pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly With his song telling my whole life, with his words Killing me softly with his song Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly With his song telling my whole life, with his words Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly With his song telling my whole life, with his words Thank you. Thank you.
