 I'm the true one. with his song killing me softly with his song telling my whole life with his words killing me softly with his song I heard his sad over the song I heard him head start so I came to see him at least to far away then everyone's a disney on the board I strangle to my eyes, strumming my bass with his finger singing my life with his words killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song telling my whole life with his words killing me softly with his song I fell on the street with a beaver and I fell in spite of the ground I fell in spite of my letters and read each one out loud and I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on from strumming my bass with his finger singing my life with his words killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song Oh-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ooh La-la la-la hot oh着过去 La-la la la la Life Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life.
