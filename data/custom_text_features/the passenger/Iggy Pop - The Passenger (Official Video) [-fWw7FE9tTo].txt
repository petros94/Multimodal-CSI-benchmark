 I am the passenger, and I ride and I ride I ride through the city taxis, I see the stars come out of the sky Yeah, the bright and hollow sky, you know it looks so good tonight I am the passenger, I stay under glass, I look through my windows so bright I see the stars come out tonight, you see the bright and hollow sky Over the city is a ripback sky, and everything looks good tonight. Sing lalalalalalalala lalalalalala lalalalalala... Get into the car, we'll be the passenger. We'll ride through the city tonight, we'll see the city's ripped back sides. We'll see the bright and hollow sky, we'll see the stars that shine so bright. A star's made for us tonight. Oh, the passenger, how he rides. Oh, the passenger, he rides and he rides. He looks through his window, what does he see? He sees the sight and hollow sky, he sees the stars come out tonight. He sees the city's ripped back sides, he sees the winding ocean drive. And everything was made for you and me, all of it was made for you and me. But it just belongs to you and me, so let's take a ride and see what's mine. Sing lalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala... Oh, the passenger, he rides and he rides. He sees things from under glass, he looks through his window inside. He sees the things he knows, he sees the bright and hollow sky. He sees the city's ripped back sides, he sees the stars come out tonight. And all of it was yours and mine, and all of it was yours and mine. So let's ride and ride and ride and ride. Lalalalalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalala... I'll sing lalalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalala... Lalalalalalalalalalalala... Thank you for watching!
